"Hey, Ash. I don't really know where to start today. I've been having a lot of those moments lately where everything feels like... too much. Like I'm stuck in the past, no matter how hard I try to move forward.",client,1,13
"That's a painful place to be. When you say you're stuck, what's keeping you there? Is it the move, or have you been thinking about something else?",therapist,2,13
"It's not the move—it's more like memories that won't let go. Sometimes it's a smell, a sound, or even just sitting alone, and I'm right back there, reliving things I wish I could forget. It feels like my mind is working against me.",client,3,13
"Can you share one of those memories with me?",therapist,4,13
"Yeah, there's one that keeps coming back. It's from my last deployment. We were out on patrol, and everything went quiet—too quiet. I knew something was wrong, but before I could react, the explosion hit. I can still hear the sound of it, feel the heat. We lost a lot that day. I can't stop replaying it, wondering if I could've done something different.",client,5,13
"Oh, wow. You're a veteran?",therapist,6,13
"Yeah, I served for almost 10 years. It was a big part of my life, and while I'm proud of my service, it left me with a lot to carry. Some days, it feels heavier than others.",client,7,13
"I can only imagine. What has it been like to have these memories keep coming back?",therapist,8,13
"It's exhausting. It's like my brain won't let me rest, even when I want to. I'll be doing something normal—watching TV or making dinner—and suddenly, I'm right back there. It's hard to explain, but it feels like I'm fighting a battle I can't win, over and over again.",client,9,13
"Well, that's where I might be able to help. Not with the memories themselves, but with the way you're responding to them. Would you want to get into that, or would it be better to focus on how you've been feeling in the moment? We could take a step back from the past, and revisit the challenges you've been having with work.",therapist,10,13
"I think focusing on how I've been responding to the memories could help. It feels like they have too much power over me, and I don't know how to stop them from taking over my day. If we could work on that, it might make things feel a bit more manageable.",client,11,13
"Okay. I want to slow down and understand this moment where you get pulled back into the memory. You mentioned it might happen when you're watching TV, or making dinner. When it happens, what do you do?",therapist,12,13
"When it happens, I usually freeze for a moment. It's like everything around me disappears, and I'm completely caught up in the memory. Sometimes I'll stop what I'm doing and just sit there, trying to push it away, but it doesn't always work. Other times, I'll try to distract myself by focusing on something else, but that doesn't always help either. It's like I'm stuck in a loop.",client,13,13
"I get that. You're trying to get your mind off it, but it keeps dragging you back. What if you tried to go with the flow, and just feel what you're feeling?",therapist,14,13
"That's a different way of looking at it. I usually try to avoid the feelings because they're so intense, but maybe letting myself feel them could help. It sounds hard, though. What if it just makes things worse?",client,15,13
"What would worse look like?",therapist,16,13
"Worse would be feeling completely overwhelmed, like I'm drowning in the memory and can't get out. I'm afraid that if I let myself fully feel it, I won't be able to pull myself back to the present. That thought is what makes me try to push it away.",client,17,13
"Ah, okay. It must be terrifying, to get so absorbed in those details. Could you tell me more about what these flashbacks are like, when they happen? Are they just as vivid as the original experience?",therapist,18,13
"Yeah, they're vivid—sometimes too vivid. It's like I'm right back there, seeing, hearing, and feeling everything all over again. My heart races, my chest tightens, and I feel completely trapped in that moment. It's like my mind can't tell the difference between now and then, and that makes it so hard to pull myself out of it.",client,19,13
"So in that moment, your body is 100% reliving what happened. And you've avoided letting that happen, because you're worried it could overwhelm you.",therapist,20,13
"Exactly. It's like my body is on high alert, as if I'm in danger all over again. I've been avoiding it because I don't know if I can handle letting it take over. It feels safer to keep it at arm's length, even though that hasn't really been working either.",client,21,13
"I'm curious why you said that, actually. Would you say that it's hurting you, to keep the memories at bay?",therapist,22,13
"Yeah, I think it is. Pushing them away hasn't made them go away—it's just made them feel heavier when they come back. It's like I'm constantly bracing myself, and that's exhausting. I guess I've been trying to protect myself, but it's not really working.",client,23,13
"Exactly. And there are a lot of ways to work with these memories, but the first step is to get comfortable with the idea of not avoiding them. What would it look like if you didn't push away?",therapist,24,13
"If I didn't push away, I think I'd have to face the fear head-on. It would mean letting the feelings wash over me and hoping I could stay grounded. I guess it might look like sitting with the memory instead of running from it, even though that feels overwhelming to imagine.",client,25,13
"I know it does. But honestly, the goal here wouldn't be to let yourself get swept away. It would be to get a bit more used to those intense feelings, so that they don't sock you in the gut every time. Does that make sense?",therapist,26,13
"Yeah, that makes sense. It's about building up some resilience to those feelings, right? So they don't completely take over every time they hit. I think I could try that—it sounds hard, but also like it might be worth it in the long run.",client,27,13
"Right. So if you could imagine yourself trying that, what might it look like?",therapist,28,13
"I guess it might look like me setting aside a quiet moment, maybe sitting in a safe space at home, and letting myself focus on the memory without trying to block it out. I'd try to notice what I'm feeling—physically and emotionally—and remind myself that I'm safe now, even if the memory feels real. It's about taking it slow, right? Not rushing through it?",client,29,13
"Exactly. I mean, does that feel like something you could picture yourself doing? It'd be a pretty major shift from what you've been doing so far.",therapist,30,13
"I think I can picture it. It does feel like a big shift, but maybe that's what I need. The way I've been handling things hasn't been working, so trying something different might be worth it. I'd need to take it slow, though—one step at a time.",client,31,13
"And what might that first step look like?",therapist,32,13
"The first step might be as simple as setting aside five minutes in a quiet space, just to sit with my thoughts. Maybe I could focus on my breathing and remind myself that I'm safe now. I wouldn't try to tackle the biggest memories right away—just ease into it and see how it feels.",client,33,13
"That's huge, Marcus. It won't be an easy practice, but if you can stick with it I think it could really change your relationship to these memories. When do you think you'll get the chance to try it out?",therapist,34,13
"Thanks, Ash. I think I could try it tomorrow evening. I'll make sure I have some quiet time set aside after dinner. It feels a little intimidating, but I'm willing to give it a shot. I appreciate you helping me figure out a way to approach this.",client,35,13
