"Hi, Ash. I don't even know where to start today. Everything just feels... heavy. I keep thinking about Mark, and I don't know how I'm supposed to move forward.",client,1,18
"Tell me more about Mark, who is he?",therapist,2,18
"Mark was my older brother. He was the kind of person who could light up a room—always cracking jokes, always making people feel at ease. He was my rock, you know? The one I could turn to for advice, or just to laugh about something silly. Losing him so suddenly... it feels like I've lost a part of myself.",client,3,18
"Oh, wow. Was this recent? I don't think you'd mentioned it, but everything must be feeling so raw.",therapist,4,18
"Yeah, it was just a couple of weeks ago. It still doesn't feel real. One moment he was here, and the next... he wasn't. Everything reminds me of him, and it's like I'm stuck in this fog. Some days I can barely get out of bed. It's so raw, and I don't know how to deal with it.",client,5,18
"I'm so sorry, Lisa. It was so sudden, and it's only been a couple of weeks. It makes sense that everything is feeling so heavy.",therapist,6,18
"Thank you, Ash. It helps to hear that... like it's okay to feel this way. Everyone keeps telling me to stay strong, but honestly, I don't feel strong at all. I just feel lost without him. It's like I'm trying to hold it together, but I don't even know where to start.",client,7,18
"Well, what if you didn't have to pull yourself together, at least not right away? Mark meant so much to you. If you need time to mourn, then take it! I'm not sure that strong is the best way to be when you've just lost a brother.",therapist,8,18
"You're right... maybe I don't have to be strong all the time. It's just so hard to let myself fall apart, even though I know I probably need to. Mark was always the one I leaned on, and now that he's gone, I feel like I don't know how to lean on anyone else.",client,9,18
"What a painful experience, to lose someone who was there for you in that way. I know it must be hard to imagine getting through this without him.",therapist,10,18
"It really is. He was always my go-to, the person I could count on no matter what. I keep reaching for my phone to text him, and then I remember... he's not there anymore. It's like there's this huge void, and I don't know how to fill it. I just miss him so much.",client,11,18
"And you're missing the support he gave you, too. If you don't mind me asking, has anyone else stepped in to help out, even a little bit? You mentioned that people have been encouraging you to stay strong, but I assume some of them must know what you're going through.",therapist,12,18
"My parents have been trying—they're grieving too, though, and I don't want to put too much on them. A couple of close friends have checked in, but I haven't really opened up to anyone. I just don't know how to talk about it without breaking down, and I'm afraid of burdening them. Mark was the one who always knew what to say. Without him, it's hard to let others in.",client,13,18
"You're missing your brother, and you're missing the way he made you feel - like you had someone to lean on.",therapist,14,18
"Exactly. It's not just losing Mark—it's losing the safety and comfort he gave me. He was always there, no matter what. I don't know how to find that kind of support anywhere else, or if I even can. It feels like such a big hole to fill.",client,15,18
"Well, to your point, he was your go-to. It's not something you can replace, even if you wanted to! If you did try leaning on someone else, though, who do you think you'd choose? Would it be one of your parents, or maybe one of those friends?",therapist,16,18
"So you could open up to her, but you don't want to overwhelm her. Is she the type of person to get overwhelmed, or is there a different reason you're holding back?",therapist,18,18
"No, she's not the type to get overwhelmed—if anything, she's always been incredibly patient and supportive. I think it's more about me. I don't want to feel like I'm dumping all of this on her or becoming a burden. I know she'd want to help, but it's hard to let myself be that vulnerable, even with someone I trust.",client,19,18
"That makes sense. I mean, you were just saying that you haven't let yourself fall apart. What would it mean if you did?",therapist,20,18
"I think it would mean admitting how much I'm struggling. That I'm not as strong as everyone thinks I am. It's scary to let go like that—to let myself feel everything. Part of me worries that if I do fall apart, I won't be able to put myself back together again.",client,21,18
"At the same time, you're carrying a lot. It makes sense that it would be scary to think about letting it all go, but I wonder if there's a way to share some of this pain, without losing yourself in it completely.",therapist,22,18
"Maybe there is. I guess I could try opening up to Rachel, just a little at first—maybe not everything all at once. It might help to have someone else carry even a small piece of this with me. I don't have to do it all alone, do I?",client,23,18
"You definitely don't. And you're right, that would be a pretty big step. If you took it, what would you want Rachel to know? Would it just be about Mark, and how much you miss him, or would you also talk about how it's been to grieve without him?",therapist,24,18
"I think I'd want her to know both. I'd want to talk about Mark—how amazing he was, how much he meant to me. But also about how hard it's been since he's been gone. It feels like grief is this isolating thing, and maybe if I shared it, it wouldn't feel so lonely. It's just scary to take that step, you know? To actually say it out loud.",client,25,18
It's a big step. Let's stay with the scary part for a moment. What's the fear telling you?,therapist,26,18
"The fear is telling me that if I open up, it might make everything feel more real—like saying it out loud will make the pain even harder to bear. And what if Rachel doesn't know what to say, or she feels uncomfortable? I don't want to push her away or make things awkward between us. It's a lot to put on someone.",client,27,18
"Well, it is, and it isn't. People have different capacities for support, and if Rachel has been reaching out, that's a good sign. Do you think she'd be able to handle a conversation like this?",therapist,28,18
"Yeah, I think she could. Rachel's always been a good listener, and she's never made me feel judged or unwelcome. I guess it's more about me trusting that she really means it when she says she's here for me. Maybe I should give her a chance to show me that she can handle this.",client,29,18
"That all sounds smart, and really specific! How soon could you get started, do you think? Would it be doable to take stock of your wins tonight, for example?",therapist,30,18
"I think it would start with a message, something simple like asking if she has some time to talk. I'd let her know that I've been thinking about Mark and how I've been feeling, and I'd ask if she's okay with listening. I wouldn't want to unload everything at once, but just open the door for a conversation.",client,31,18
"If she agreed, would you do that in person? Or over the phone?",therapist,32,18
"I think I'd prefer in person if it's possible. It feels more personal, and I'd want her to see how much this means to me. But if that's not doable, a phone call might work—it's better than keeping it bottled up.",client,33,18
I love how thoughtful you are being about this. And you said you'll reach out soon - when do you think that might be?,therapist,34,18
"I think I could try reaching out in the next couple of days. Maybe even tomorrow, if I feel up to it. It's nerve-wracking, but it feels important to do sooner rather than later.",client,35,18
"Right, especially since you've been dealing with so much on your own. For what it's worth, I really hope that Rachel can help. But either way, I'm glad you're taking this step.",therapist,36,18
"Thank you. That means a lot. I hope she can too, but even just deciding to do this feels like a step in the right direction.",client,37,18
