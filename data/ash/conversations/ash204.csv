"Hi Miss Clark, I've been thinking about the stress you shared last time. How are things feeling today?",therapist,1,204
"Well, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I've been trying to cut down on the wine, like we discussed, but it's been tough. The stress doesn't just disappear, and I find myself reaching for a glass when it gets too much. But I'm trying, really. I just need to find a better way to cope, I guess.",client,2,204
"Right, you've got a ton on your plate! Would you say you're drinking more than you usually would, then? Or is this a long-term pattern?",therapist,3,204
"Well, I'd say it's become a bit of a pattern. But it's definitely gotten worse with all the stress recently. I mean, before it was just a glass or two with dinner, you know? But now it seems like it's becoming a crutch, a way to escape the stress, even if just for a little while. And I know it's not the best coping mechanism.",client,4,204
"On some level, it works, right? It helps you escape, and you get a break from the stress. But on the other hand, you've been thinking that you want to cut back. What's motivating you there?",therapist,5,204
"Well, there's a few things. Firstly, I guess I'm worried about the impact on my health. I know too much wine isn't good for me. And then there's the financial aspect. I like good wine, and it's not cheap. I've noticed my spending on wine going up and that's just adding to my financial stress. And then, I suppose, there's the fact that I don't want to become dependent on it. I don't want to need wine to handle my stress. I want to be able to handle it on my own.",client,6,204
"Got it. So if you could find another way to do that, what do you think would change? Would you start to feel better, or more in control?",therapist,7,204
"Definitely, I think it would make a huge difference. I'd feel healthier, and I'd have less financial stress. I think I'd also feel more in control, like I'm taking care of myself and handling my problems in a healthier way. But I'm not really sure how to make that change, it feels like a big step.",client,8,204
What would you say feels big about it?,therapist,9,204
"Well, it's like I've built this routine around wine. It's part of my coping mechanism now. And while I know it's not the best, it's familiar, it's comfortable. To change that feels... daunting. I'm not sure what I would replace it with or how I could handle the stress without it. It's a little scary to think about.",client,10,204
"So it's become pretty central to how you unwind. When you don't have it, or you try to cut back, do you get anxious? Or is it more that you're worried about what might happen if you were to quit?",therapist,11,204
"It's a bit of both, I suppose. I do feel anxious when I try to cut back, like I'm missing out on something that helps me cope. But I'm also worried about what will happen if I quit. How will I handle the stress? What will I do when I have a bad day? I guess I'm scared of facing those moments without my usual safety net.",client,12,204
"Let's picture a bad day. What happens, and what's the hardest part?",therapist,13,204
"Well, it starts with waking up stressed, knowing I've got so much to handle, from work to my kids. The day just keeps piling up with tasks and responsibilities. The hardest part is the constant pressure, the never-ending cycle of it all. And at the end of the day, I'm just exhausted, mentally and physically. That's when I usually reach for a glass of wine. It feels like my only break, my only moment of relief.",client,14,204
"And then once you've had that moment, do you just crash? Or do the tasks and responsibilities keep coming?",therapist,15,204
"Honestly, it's a bit of both. After that glass of wine, I do feel a momentary relief, I feel like I can breathe again. But then, the reality of everything comes rushing back. Sometimes, it's manageable and other times it feels like I'm drowning. That's usually when I reach for another glass.",client,16,204
"So the wine helps, but only temporarily. And then the tasks and responsibilities are still there.",therapist,17,204
"Exactly. It's like a brief escape, but it doesn't really solve anything. It just postpones the stress, I guess. And then, when the effects of the wine wear off, I'm back where I started. It's not really a solution, I know that. It's just... hard to break away from it.",client,18,204
"I hear you. And just to clarify, when you say 'back where you started' â€“ how much do you actually get done, when you're drinking? Does it get in the way at all?",therapist,19,204
"Honestly, it's a bit of a double-edged sword. In the moment, it feels like I'm able to relax, to let go of the stress a bit, and sometimes that actually helps me get things done. But other times, especially on those nights when I have a bit too much, it definitely gets in the way. I wake up groggy, feeling awful, and it's hard to get anything done when you're in that state. Not to mention, I'm starting to worry about the example I'm setting for my kids. They're smart, they pick up on these things.",client,20,204
What do you worry that they might be picking up on?,therapist,21,204
"Well, I worry they're seeing their mom rely on wine to deal with stress. I don't want them to think that's the right way to handle things. I also worry about the mood swings. I mean, I try to hide it, but I know I can be irritable and snappy, especially when I'm hungover. I don't want them to bear the brunt of my stress and poor coping mechanisms. They deserve better than that.",client,22,204
"So you're really motivated to be a positive influence in their lives, and to set a good example. Would you say that's your main reason for wanting to change? Or is it more about feeling different in yourself? You mentioned wanting to feel healthier, too.",therapist,23,204
"It's definitely a bit of both. I want to be a good role model for my kids, but I also want to feel better myself. I mean, I don't want to rely on wine to cope. I want to be able to handle my stress in a healthier way. Plus, I have to admit, I'm tired of the hangovers and the guilt that comes with them. I want to feel healthier, more in control.",client,24,204
