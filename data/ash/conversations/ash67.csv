"Of course, we can shift gears. What's just come to mind?",therapist,1,67
"Well, it's been a lot of things really. I've been feeling really overwhelmed at work. It's like I can't focus fully on anything, and I keep making mistakes that I wouldn't normally make. It's so unlike me and it's causing me to feel even more stressed out. And then there's the whole problem with my sleep... or lack thereof. It's like my mind just won't shut up, you know? And when I do manage to fall asleep, I wake up still feeling exhausted. It's like a vicious cycle. I also noticed that I've been avoiding social gatherings and just want to be alone most of the time. I don't know, is this normal?",client,2,67
"It's not unusual to feel out of it when you're dealing with health issues, and not sleeping well. But what's the impact been, socially? Has anyone noticed that you're withdrawing?",therapist,3,67
"Yeah, some of my friends have asked me if something is wrong. They've noticed that I've been canceling plans and not answering texts as often. My boss also asked me the other day if everything is okay because he noticed that my performance has been off. And I just... I don't know how to explain what I'm feeling. I'm not even sure what it is. It's just this feeling of emptiness and constant exhaustion. It's like I'm living in a fog. Do you think this is depression?",client,4,67
"I think it's a good thing that you're noticing this shift. But I wonder if we can explore it a bit more, and figure out what might be happening.",therapist,5,67
"Yeah, I would really like to understand what's happening to me. I've tried to analyze it myself, and sometimes I think maybe I'm just burned out from work. But then there are these moments when I'm not doing anything and I just feel... empty. I even stopped going to the gym, which used to be my go-to stress reliever. It's like I don't have the energy or the motivation to do anything anymore. I've also lost my appetite, I've been skipping meals, and I've lost some weight. I just... I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel like I'm just going through the motions. And it's so frustrating because I don't know why I'm feeling this way",client,6,67
"Well, you've got a lot to be frustrated about, don't you? With the headaches, and the nausea, and the nightmares, and everything else. But even so, it seems like things have gotten worse, or heavier, over the past few weeks. Would you agree?",therapist,7,67
"Yes, definitely. It feels like I'm carrying around a heavy weight all the time. I just feel really down, and I can't seem to shake it off. But the worst part is, I don't even know why I'm feeling this way. I just want to feel like myself again.",client,8,67
What is it like to not feel like yourself?,therapist,9,67
"It's... it's strange. It's like I'm watching myself from afar, going through the motions of life, but not really participating. Everything feels so dull and colorless. It's like there's a cloud hanging over everything. I often find myself just sitting there, staring at nothing, lost in my thoughts. And I'm usually such an outgoing and energetic person, so this isn't like me at all. It's just... I don't know, it's scary. I want to get back to being me, but I don't know how.",client,10,67
"I mean, you've been dealing with some pretty extreme circumstances. What with the health stuff, and the anxiety that came with it, has it been hard to stay in touch with that more energetic version of yourself?",therapist,11,67
"Yeah, extremely hard. It's like I'm trapped in this foggy, grey version of myself and I can't get out. I used to be so lively, so full of energy and now... now it feels like I'm just dragging myself through each day. It's like I'm looking at the world through a grey filter. All the colors, all the excitement seems to have drained out. I miss the old me but I just can't seem to find my way back.",client,12,67
"There's this fog, and it's really getting in the way. I know you're longing to feel a bit more like you. Can you tell me about the version of you that you miss?",therapist,13,67
"The version of me I miss is the one who used to wake up excited about the day ahead. The one who was always on the go, always ready for the next adventure. I used to be so passionate about my work, about my hobbies, about life in general. I used to be the person who would organize outings with friends, who would always be there to lend a hand, who was always full of energy and laughter. I was known for my positivity, my resilience. And now, it's like that person is just... gone. I don't feel that spark, that excitement anymore. I just feel... empty. And I hate it. I hate feeling like this.",client,14,67
"I get why you'd be frustrated! But as far as I know, that person hasn't gone anywhere. She's just been in survival mode for a little while, and it's taking a toll. Would it help if I gave you a bit more context on why that's happening? You mentioned that you might be burned out, and I think that's actually a possibility!",therapist,15,67
"Really? Burnout? I mean, work has been pretty intense lately, but I didn't think it could affect me to this extent. I've always been able to handle stress well, or at least I thought I did. But now that I think about it, it's been a constant stream of deadlines and pressure for quite a while. Could that really be the cause of all this? Is this what burnout feels like?",client,16,67
"Let's think of it this way. If you hadn't been experiencing all this work stress, do you think your health worries would be affecting you as much as they are?",therapist,17,67
"I honestly don't know. I mean, the health worries are a big part of it, but they've been there for a while, even before the work stress got to this level. But I guess they've become more prominent now that I'm also dealing with this overwhelming work stress. It's like everything is just piling up and I can't deal with it all. Maybe if it was just one or the other, I could handle it. But both together... it's just too much.",client,18,67
"Right. The pressure has been coming at you from every angle, and it's been hard to escape. But for the moment, could we try focusing on work, and how that's been affecting you? It might give us a better understanding of what you need.",therapist,19,67
"Sure, I can try. Work has always been really important to me. I've always been very ambitious, and I'm proud of what I've achieved. But lately, it's like I'm just going through the motions. I'm not enjoying it anymore. The pressure to perform, to meet deadlines, to keep up with the pace... it's just too much. And I can't seem to disconnect. Even when I'm not at work, I can't stop thinking about it. I keep worrying about the tasks waiting for me, about the mistakes I might have made. It's like my mind is constantly in work mode, even when I try to relax. And the worst part is that I can see it affecting my performance",client,20,67
What's it been like to see this part of you that was so ambitious and proud start to fade?,therapist,21,67
"It's been really difficult. I've always prided myself on my work ethic and my ability to excel in my career. Seeing that fade away, seeing myself struggle to keep up, it's really been a blow to my self-esteem. I feel like I'm losing a part of my identity. It's like I'm failing myself. And I don't know how to fix it. It's been really disheartening.",client,22,67
"So it feels like you've been falling short, which really isn't a pleasant feeling. On the other hand, though, you've also been working super hard! Given that, could we try tweaking your perspective, just a bit? I know it might be a leap, but what if you looked at this period as a temporary dip, instead of a failure?",therapist,23,67
"A temporary dip? I guess I've never really thought about it that way. I've been so caught up in feeling like I'm failing that I haven't considered that this could just be a rough patch. But it's been going on for a while, and it feels like it's just getting worse. How do I get out of this dip?",client,24,67
"I think that question is really central. If we were to brainstorm, what would you imagine?",therapist,25,67
"Brainstorming? I suppose I could try and take some time off work, maybe a few days or a week. I've been reluctant to do that because I worry about the work piling up. But I guess I could use the break to rest and maybe find ways to deal with my stress. I've also thought about seeking professional help from a psychologist or a counselor. Maybe they can help me figure out how to navigate through all of this. But I don't know if these ideas are enough or if they will even work.",client,26,67
"Well, they definitely might! You actually seemed pretty open to therapy, when we talked about it before. Was that just because you needed help with your health anxiety, or have you been thinking about it more broadly? It could be a great way to get some more support.",therapist,27,67
"I have been thinking about it more broadly. I mean, I initially thought I needed help for my health anxiety, but now... now I feel like I might need help with more than that. With this overwhelming feeling of sadness, with this constant stress, with my inability to disconnect from work. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know how to swim back to the surface. I think therapy might be a good idea. I just... I just want to feel like myself again.",client,28,67
"I can hear how much you want that. I want to pause here and reflect on how much you're juggling. You're managing health anxiety, work stress, and a whole lot else. So it's understandable that you've been feeling this way, and it makes a lot of sense that you're looking for some extra support. What would make it possible for you to reach out for help?",therapist,29,67
"I've been thinking about it a lot, and I guess taking the first step and admitting that I need help was a big one. I'm not very good at asking for help, you know? I've always been the one who's got everything under control. But I guess recognizing that I can't do this on my own is important. I've started looking up therapists in my area and I plan to schedule an appointment soon. I think I also need to have a conversation with my boss about my workload. I've been avoiding it because I don't want to seem like I can't handle it, but I think it's necessary. I also plan to take some time off work to rest and try to regain my energy. I",client,30,67
"I mean, you can handle a lot! And you've been doing your best to power through this, even though you're not feeling like yourself. Would it be fair to say that you're putting some of your pride aside, and doing what you have to do?",therapist,31,67
"Yes, I guess that's a fair way to put it. I've always been proud of my ability to handle everything on my own, to stay strong no matter what. But I'm starting to realize that it's okay to ask for help. That it doesn't make me weak or less capable. It's been a tough realization, but I think it's a necessary one. I just hope that it helps. I just want to feel better, to feel like myself again.",client,32,67
"You're taking really proactive steps to get back to that place! Both with therapy, and with the plan to talk to your boss. What would be most helpful to talk through here?",therapist,33,67
"I think what I'm most anxious about is the conversation with my boss. I'm not quite sure how to approach it. I don't want to come off as incompetent or unable to handle my workload. But at the same time, I need to communicate that I'm struggling and need some adjustments. And then there's the whole issue of asking for time off. I haven't taken a vacation in years and the thought of asking for one now, when we're so busy... I just don't know how to navigate that. It just feels like a lot right now and I could use some guidance.",client,34,67
"Okay. Well, if we think back to when you first started feeling this way, how long has it been? Could you even put a number on it?",therapist,35,67
"I guess it's been around six months now. It all started with the health issues, and then the workload at work started increasing around the same time. At first, I thought I could handle it, you know? I've always been able to juggle multiple things at once. But as the months passed, it just started feeling like too much. And now, I'm here, feeling like I'm caught in a storm with no way out. It's been a difficult six months.",client,36,67
