"Of course! What did you have in mind?",therapist,1,75
"Well, I've been trying to come up with strategies to cope, you know? Like, I tried deep breathing exercises and visualization. But, I still find myself lost in the same cycle of worry and... escape. It feels like I'm constantly in this state of fight or flight. I just... I don't know how to break out of it.",client,2,75
"You've tried a few things already. Say more about what this cycle looks like.",therapist,3,75
"Well, the cycle starts with me getting the assignment or the task. I immediately start worrying about it, thinking about all the things that could go wrong. Then, I try to prepare, but my mind is all over the place, and I can't focus. The worry just consumes me, and then I start thinking about escaping, about how much easier it would be if I just didn't have to do it. The thought of presenting or doing the task just fills me with so much anxiety that I can't concentrate on anything else. And then, when the time comes, I'm so worked up that I can't perform at my best. And then the cycle starts all over again with the next assignment or task.",client,4,75
"Right, so you're anticipating that it'll go badly, and then that exact thing happens. How often has that been the case, by the way? Are you really bombing these presentations, or are they turning out better than you expect?",therapist,5,75
"Well, there are times when I do better than I expect, but it's not very often. I feel like most of the time, my worry and anxiety get the best of me and I don't perform as well as I know I can. It's like my fear of messing up creates this self-fulfilling prophecy. I get so caught up in my own head that I can't get out of my own way.",client,6,75
"Say more about that. How do you get in your own way?",therapist,7,75
"I guess I let my fear and my anxiety control me. I mean, I know deep down that I can do these presentations, that I know the material and that I have the capability to do well. But, I can't stop the negative thoughts from taking over. They just spiral out of control until I'm convinced that I'm going to fail. In a way, I guess I sabotage myself. I let my fear dictate my actions instead of my knowledge and my abilities. It's like I'm battling with two parts of myself - the part that knows I can do it and the part that is scared I can't. And, unfortunately, it seems like the scared part wins most of the time.",client,8,75
"Well, it might be winning, but only because you're trying really hard to escape it. When you picture yourself getting up in front of the class, what are you most afraid will happen?",therapist,9,75
"I think I'm afraid of being judged, you know? Like, I'm scared that they'll see me struggle and they'll think less of me. And I'm also scared of disappointing myself. I know I can do better, but when the anxiety takes over, I feel like I just can't. It's a constant battle between what I know I can do and what my anxiety tells me I can't.",client,10,75
"Ah, the judgement. And if they thought less of you, what would that say about you?",therapist,11,75
"I guess it would just confirm the negative thoughts I already have about myself. That I'm not good enough, that I can't handle the pressure. It's like, if they see me fail, then it must be true. And that's a hard pill to swallow.",client,12,75
"Right. You'd be proving them right! But when you think about your classmates, do you actually believe that they're thinking those things? Or is that coming from you?",therapist,13,75
"I... I'm not sure. I mean, I feel like it's me, you know? Like, I'm the one who is feeding those thoughts, making them real. But then, I can't help but think that maybe they do see me that way. Maybe they see the worry, the panic, the struggle, and they think less of me. It's hard to tell where my thoughts end and reality begins.",client,14,75
"Let's try to sort that out a bit more. What evidence do you have that they might be judging you?",therapist,15,75
"Well, I don't really have any concrete evidence, you know? It's more of a feeling. I guess I interpret their expressions, their silences. Maybe it's just my own insecurities projecting onto them. But it feels so real. I often think they must be judging me, that they must see me as this anxious, incapable person.",client,16,75
"Okay, but as far as you can tell, you haven't actually heard them say so. Now, what about yourself? You've got this story in your head that you're not good enough, but where did it come from?",therapist,17,75
"I don't know, really. I guess it's been there for as long as I can remember. I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, always setting really high standards for myself. I guess the thought of not meeting those standards is just really scary for me. It feels like if I don't meet them, then I've failed. And that's a really hard thing for me to accept.",client,18,75
"If you go and give a speech in class, and it doesn't go perfectly, what does that mean about you?",therapist,19,75
"It means I've failed. I can't help but feel that way. If it's not perfect, if I stumble, if I lose my train of thought, it just feels like I've let myself down. Like I didn't prepare enough or I didn't try hard enough. It's like a reflection of my worth, you know? If I don't do well, then it means I'm not good enough. I know it sounds harsh but that's how it feels for me.",client,20,75
"I see. So there's a standard here that you really can't afford to compromise on. But what if you did, just a little? What if you let yourself stumble, and didn't give yourself such a hard time about it?",therapist,21,75
