What did you want to cover today?,therapist,1,27
"Well, I guess I want to delve a little deeper into my relationship with my parents. I feel like it's affecting my current relationships and I want to understand it better, you know?",client,2,27
"Okay, interesting! How is it affecting your current relationships?",therapist,3,27
"Well, it's just... I find myself getting anxious whenever my current partner shows any signs of unpredictability, you know? It reminds me a lot of my mom's chaotic behavior, and it's like I'm on edge, waiting for them to let me down or leave. It's like I'm constantly expecting the worst.",client,4,27
"And how does she act, exactly? I'm guessing she's not literally walking out on you, but maybe she has in the past?",therapist,5,27
"No, she hasn't walked out on me. But her emotions can be... unpredictable. One moment she's on cloud nine, and the next she's so upset about something, it's like walking on eggshells. It's like my mom all over again. She's not abusive or anything, but it's hard not knowing what mood she'll be in from one moment to the next. My mom, she used to be like that, always jumping from one mood to another, or from one husband to another. It was hard to keep up.",client,6,27
"So as a child, you'd be on your toes, trying to figure out what mood people were in.",therapist,7,27
"Yes, exactly. I kind of had to be cautious all the time, you know? I never knew what I was walking into with my mom, and I guess I... I brought that cautiousness into my adult relationships. It feels like I can't quite let my guard down. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak.",client,8,27
"Well, that totally makes sense! You've learned to be vigilant, because that kept you safe as a kid. But are you thinking that it's less useful at this stage in your life?",therapist,9,27
"Yeah, exactly. It's like I'm still that kid, waiting for my mom to switch moods or husbands. And I know my partner isn't my mom. She's not going to abandon me or suddenly become a different person. But I can't seem to shake off that fear, you know? It's like I'm stuck in this pattern and I don't know how to break out of it.",client,10,27
"I want to get a sense of how this pattern plays out in your relationship. When you say that you expect your partner to let you down, what does that look like?",therapist,11,27
"Well, it's kind of hard to explain. I guess... I'm always expecting her to change her mind about something, or to react in a way that I wasn't expecting. For example, if she's in a good mood and I do something small, like forget to take out the trash or something, I'm always bracing myself for her to get really upset. Even though she usually doesn't, I can't help but expect the worst. It's like I'm always on high alert, waiting for something to go wrong.",client,12,27
"Ah, got it. And when you're in that headspace, do you behave differently? Are you extra careful about what you do and say?",therapist,13,27
"Yeah, for sure. I mean, I find myself constantly trying to anticipate her needs, or what might set her off, even though, like I said, she's not really volatile or anything. It's just... I guess I'm so used to walking on eggshells around my mom that I've carried that behavior into my own relationships. I don't want to make any mistakes or upset anyone, so I end up being really cautious and overly attentive. It's exhausting, to be honest.",client,14,27
"What do you think your partner would say about it, if she were here?",therapist,15,27
I think she'd say that she notices my anxiety and that it's hard for her too. She'd probably say that she feels like she's constantly being analyzed or studied. And she's told me before that she feels like she can't be herself around me because I'm always anticipating her reactions. She'd probably also say that she wishes I could just relax and trust her.,client,16,27
"Yikes. So not only are you getting tired of this pattern, but she is, too! Has it ever caused a conflict between you? Or has it mostly just been a source of stress?",therapist,17,27
"Yeah, it's definitely been a source of stress for both of us. I mean, we've had arguments about it, for sure. She gets frustrated because she feels like I don't trust her to handle her own emotions and I get defensive because I feel like she doesn't understand why I'm acting this way. It's just... it's a cycle, you know? We're both tired of it. I don't want to expect the worst from her, I want to trust her. I just... I don't know how to break this pattern. It's like I'm wired to be on guard all the time.",client,18,27
"You've got this defensive instinct, and I wonder what would happen if you tried to soften it. What does it look like to trust her?",therapist,19,27
"I guess... trusting her would mean not constantly expecting her to react negatively or unpredictably. It would mean feeling safe and secure in the relationship, knowing that she's not going to suddenly change or abandon me. I want to be able to relax and just enjoy our time together without always being on high alert. I just... I'm not sure how to get there, you know?",client,20,27
"Well, you mentioned that she hasn't been volatile up to this point. She's had some ups and downs, but nothing like what you experienced with your mom. Would you say that's right?",therapist,21,27
"Yeah, that's correct. She's definitely not volatile like my mom was. She's much more stable and consistent. But I guess my past experiences have kind of... programmed me to expect that kind of behavior, even when it's not there. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, even though it never does. It's just... frustrating, you know?",client,22,27
"Past experiences have programmed you to expect volatility. But in the present, you're describing a person who's stable, and reliable. I'm wondering what it might be like to really notice those qualities.",therapist,23,27
"I mean, I do notice them. I see how she's consistent and reliable, and it's one of the things I love about her. But somehow, it's like my brain just can't fully accept it, you know? It's like there's this little voice in the back of my head that keeps saying, 'but what if she changes? What if she turns out to be just like your mom?' And I hate that voice, because it's not fair to her, and it's not fair to me. But I don't know how to make it stop.",client,24,27
"Right, because it's not just a voice. It's a whole set of beliefs and behaviors that you learned over the course of many years, and for a while, they really helped you. But if they're not helping anymore, we could try to challenge them, and see if you can think about this relationship in a different way. Does that sound worth doing?",therapist,25,27
"Yeah, it's definitely worth trying. I'm just... I'm not sure how to start, you know? It's like this has been my default setting for so long, I'm not sure how to change it. But I want to. I really do. I just... I want to be able to trust my partner and feel secure in our relationship. I don't want to keep expecting the worst, because she doesn't deserve that, and neither do I. I just... I need some help figuring out how to get there.",client,26,27
"One thing that might be worth trying is to start to notice this voice, and to label it as such. We can give it a name, or a shape. We can recognize it as a story, rooted in the past, or as a habit. And then we can play with letting it be there without believing it. What would you say to that?",therapist,27,27
"I guess that could work... I mean, it sounds a bit strange, giving my thoughts a name or shape. But I'm willing to try anything at this point. I just want to get past this. I want to be able to trust her, to let go of these fears. It's not fair to either of us. So yeah, let's do it. Let's give this voice a name and try to challenge it. I'm ready to start making changes.",client,28,27
