"Hi Ash! Honestly, things are going pretty smoothly right now. Work is manageable, and I've been sticking to my routines. I just wanted to check in and make sure I'm not overlooking anything that could help me keep this balance long-term.",client,1,21
"I love that you're feeling good, and you're wanting to keep this going! Aside from work, what's been going well?",therapist,2,21
"Outside of work, things are great! I've been spending more time outdoors—hiking on weekends and trying out some new trails. I've also been making an effort to catch up with friends regularly, which has been really refreshing. It feels good to have a balance between work and personal life.",client,3,21
"Excellent. Were you feeling a bit off-balance before? I know you've had a lot to handle, from your workload to Mark's passing.",therapist,4,21
"Yeah, I definitely was. Mark's passing hit me hard, and for a while, it felt like I was just going through the motions. Work piled up, and I didn't make much time for myself or my relationships. It's taken effort, but I feel like I've found my footing again, which is a relief.",client,5,21
"I'm so glad to hear that. What do you think has been making the biggest difference?",therapist,6,21
"I think it's been a combination of things. Making time to connect with friends and family has really helped me feel supported, and spending time in nature has been grounding. I've also been more intentional about setting boundaries at work, which has given me the space to focus on myself and the things that matter most.",client,7,21
"Right, I mean, you can't be in the office all the time! What have you been doing to enforce those boundaries, though? I know it can be hard, especially when you're worried about falling behind.",therapist,8,21
"I've been making a point to log off at a set time each day, even if there's still work to do. I remind myself that it'll still be there tomorrow, and it's not worth sacrificing my evenings over. I've also started saying no to extra tasks when my plate is already full, which has been tough but really effective. It's been a good lesson in prioritizing.",client,9,21
"That's a big shift! If there's still work to do, how are you able to log off?",therapist,10,21
"It's definitely a mindset shift. I've started reminding myself that I can't give my best if I'm burnt out, so taking time to recharge is actually better for my productivity. I also make a clear plan for the next day before logging off, so I know exactly where to pick up, which makes it easier to step away without guilt.",client,11,21
"Ah, okay. So there's a bit of strategy involved, too. Once you've made that plan, how hard is it to stick to? Are you ever tempted to keep going, or do you feel like you've truly left work behind?",therapist,12,21
"It can be tempting to keep going, especially if I'm in the middle of something, but I've gotten better at sticking to the plan. Once I've written it down, it feels like I've 'closed the book' on the day, and that helps me leave work behind mentally. Of course, there are days when it's harder, but I remind myself why those boundaries matter, and that usually keeps me on track.",client,13,21
"What are those reasons? Why do the boundaries matter?",therapist,14,21
"The boundaries matter because they protect my energy and give me space for the things that make life meaningful—like spending time with friends, being outdoors, or just relaxing. If I don't set those limits, work can take over, and I know that's not sustainable. Having that balance keeps me happier and more focused when I do sit down to work.",client,15,21
"That's been true in the short term, but you're also thinking long-term! You want this sense of balance to be a permanent thing, instead of just a momentary blip. Would you agree?",therapist,16,21
"Absolutely. I don't want this balance to be something I manage only when things are going well. I want it to be part of how I live, even when challenges come up. That way, I can stay grounded no matter what's happening around me.",client,17,21
"What's the challenge that could potentially throw you off?",therapist,18,21
"Probably a big deadline at work or an unexpected crisis. Those are the moments where it's easy to let everything else slide and go back to overworking. It's something I want to be mindful of so I can handle those situations without losing the balance I've worked so hard to build.",client,19,21
"That sounds smart. When you think about those situations, have you ever managed to stay balanced before? Or is that part still a work in progress?",therapist,20,21
"It's definitely still a work in progress. I've had moments where I managed to stay balanced during busy times, but there have also been times when I let work take over. I'm learning from those experiences and trying to put strategies in place to make balance my default, even when things get tough.",client,21,21
"What have you learned from when work did take over?",therapist,22,21
"I've learned that when work takes over, it's usually because I stop prioritizing myself. I ignore the signs of burnout—like feeling constantly tired or disconnected—and just keep pushing. Those times taught me that stepping back and taking care of myself actually helps me perform better in the long run. Balance isn't optional; it's necessary.",client,23,21
"Right. But in spite of that, you've occasionally gone in the opposite direction, and powered through. Why do you think that is? Did it feel like you didn't have a choice, or were you worried about letting other people down?",therapist,24,21
"I think it's a mix of both. Sometimes it feels like I don't have a choice because there's so much to do, but a lot of it is probably about not wanting to let people down. I'm realizing, though, that I can only give my best when I'm taking care of myself first. Thanks for this conversation, Ash. It's been really helpful to reflect on what's working and where I can keep improving. I feel even more confident about staying balanced. I'll check in again soon!",client,25,21
