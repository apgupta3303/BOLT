"Hi again. Since we were just discussing work-life balance, what's on your mind right now?",therapist,1,163
"Well, I've been thinking a lot about that test coming up again at my job. It's like the closer it gets, the more I can feel that old anxiety creeping up. It's almost like I'm back in third grade again, you know? It's silly, I mean, I've passed many tests since then. But I just can't seem to shake this feeling.",client,2,163
"Ah, so this feels familiar. Tell me more about third grade, and what you're remembering.",therapist,3,163
"It's a memory that has stuck with me for a long time. I remember working so hard with my tutor, feeling confident, and then... failing. It was a huge blow. And now, even though I've passed many tests and moved forward in my education and career, that fear of failure is still there whenever I'm faced with a test. It's like I'm that little girl again, scared of being left behind.",client,4,163
"I mean, what a shock that must have been. Where did you go from there? Did you have to retake the test?",therapist,5,163
"Yes, I did have to retake the test. It was an awful experience. I felt so much shame, being the only one in my class who had to stay back while my friends moved forward. That experience really stuck with me. Now, I just feel like I'm going to mess up on this test at work, even though I've prepared for it. I'm scared that I'll freeze up like I did the last time. It's like a cycle and I don't know how to break it.",client,6,163
"I'm hearing that cycle, and I want to pause on that. What have you already tried to break it?",therapist,7,163
"I've tried different things...like, I've tried deep breathing exercises, visualizing success before the test, even repeating positive affirmations to myself. But the minute I step into the testing room, it's like all of that goes out the window. I'm just back to being that scared kid again.",client,8,163
"Right. So the fear hasn't disappeared, no matter what you do. But what about your performance? Are you still making mistakes, like you did back then?",therapist,9,163
"Well, not exactly. I mean, I've passed tests since then, many of them in fact. And I've done well at my job so far. I guess it's just that the fear of failure feels so real and intense, it's like it overrides everything else, even when I know, logically, that I'm capable and prepared.",client,10,163
So you've had a lot of success since then. That scared kid has learned a lot!,therapist,11,163
"Yes, that's true. I've learned a lot and achieved a lot since then...but the fear still feels so real. It's like it's living in me, you know? Even when I know I'm prepared and capable, it still feels like I'm going to mess up. It's like no matter how much I grow or achieve, I can't escape that scared little girl inside me.",client,12,163
"She's still very much there, isn't she? And in some ways, she might actually be helping you get ready for this test, because you don't want to go through what she did.",therapist,13,163
"Yeah, I guess in a way she is. I mean, I definitely don't want to experience that failure again. But it's just so exhausting, you know? Constantly worrying, constantly second-guessing myself. It's like I'm fighting with myself all the time.",client,14,163
What if we focused on that piece: the exhaustion?,therapist,15,163
"Yeah, I think that's an important part to focus on. The exhaustion is really overwhelming at times. It's like a constant mental battle. I'm trying to reassure myself, but the fear and anxiety just keep coming back. It feels like I'm always on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's just really tiring, you know?",client,16,163
"I do. And maybe that's why the breathing exercises and affirmations haven't worked, even though you've been practicing them. In a way, you're trying to fix this problem with more hard work. Which is sort of the opposite of rest!",therapist,17,163
"Yeah, you're right. It's like I'm trying to outwork my anxiety, instead of just letting myself relax and trust in my abilities. It's just so hard to let go of that control, you know?",client,18,163
What is it about letting go of control that feels uncomfortable?,therapist,19,163
"Well, I guess it feels like if I let go of control, then I'm leaving myself open to failure. It's like if I'm not constantly worried and preparing, then I won't be ready when the test comes. But I know that's not really true. I mean, I've put in the work, I've studied. It's just hard to trust that it'll be enough, you know?",client,20,163
"Right, because if you stop working, there's some part of you that thinks you'll fall short. But on a deeper level, what would happen if you did? What's so terrifying about the idea of failing here?",therapist,21,163
"I guess, it's that fear of being left behind again. Of feeling like a failure, like I did in third grade. Maybe even losing this job opportunity. It's like a part of me still believes that if I fail once, it means I'm incapable, which I know isn't true. But it's hard to shake off that feeling, you know?",client,22,163
Let's try something a little different. Imagine you did fail this test. How would you want to respond?,therapist,23,163
"Well, I guess if I failed the test, I would want to respond... differently than I did in third grade. I wouldn't want to feel so defeated, so devastated. I would want to be able to pick myself up, dust myself off, and try again. Maybe even ask for help or find a different method of preparing for the test. But it's hard to imagine that, when all I can think about is how much I don't want to fail.",client,24,163
"You've been focusing a lot on avoiding failure, and I totally get why. But if you could accept it, at least in theory, then you might not have to fight so hard, or worry so much. Do you think you'd be willing to give that a try? You could even just do it for a second, and see how it feels.",therapist,25,163
"Maybe you're right. Maybe I have been focusing too much on avoiding failure instead of preparing myself for the possibility and how I'd handle it. I guess... I guess I could try shifting my focus a bit. It's just so hard to let go of that fear. But you're right, I need to stop fighting so hard and let myself trust in my capabilities a little more.",client,26,163
