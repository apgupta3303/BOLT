What did you want to get into today?,therapist,1,206
"I've been thinking a lot about my future lately. About how I can turn my life around and make something of myself. You know, maybe even go back to school or find a job that I actually enjoy. Something that'll make me feel like I'm not just wasting my life away.",client,2,206
"Interesting! You've been super focused on tackling your anxiety, so it's cool to hear you thinking more long-term. What would you be looking for in a new job, ideally?",therapist,3,206
"Honestly, I'd love to do something that allows me to tap into my creative side. I used to really enjoy making model airplanes as a kid, and the idea of designing or working with them in some capacity still excites me. I know it might sound childish, but that's the kind of passion I want in a job.",client,4,206
"Not childish at all! Tell me more about what you loved about it, making those models.",therapist,5,206
"Well, it was like I was creating my own little world, you know? Each model needed careful attention, precise movements. I loved that concentration, that focus. And once I was done, I'd look at this small piece of wonder in front of me and I'd just feel...proud. Like I had achieved something. And then there was the thrill of imagining them soaring through the skies, the freedom, the speed. I guess in a way, it was an escape.",client,6,206
"When you look back on that time, do you feel like you needed an escape?",therapist,7,206
"Yeah, I suppose I did need an escape. School was always tough for me, you know. I was always the class clown, always in trouble. I didn't fit in, and working on those model airplanes was a way for me to feel accomplished, to feel like I was good at something. It was a world where I could control the outcome, where I didn't have to worry about being judged or misunderstood.",client,8,206
"It was a place where you could accomplish things, and l good about yourself.",therapist,9,206
"Client: Yeah, that's it exactly. It was my own little world where I felt accomplished and in control. It's a feeling I've been missing in my adult life, I guess. That's why I've been thinking about finding a way to bring that passion back, maybe even turn it into a career. But I don't know if it's even possible. It seems like such a big step, you know?",client,10,206
"It would be, especially since you'd need to make a lot of changes. But I can see why you'd want to! As it stands, are you not feeling all that accomplished, or in control?",therapist,11,206
"Client: Yeah, you hit the nail on the head there. Right now, I don't feel accomplished at all, and I definitely don't feel in control. It's like I'm just going through the motions, you know? I'm not really progressing or achieving anything. I feel stuck. And yeah, the thought of making these big changes is scary. But the idea of staying in this rut is even scarier.",client,12,206
Tell me more about this rut. What feels stuck?,therapist,13,206
"Well, it's like I'm in this cycle of mediocrity. I wake up, go to my boring job at the restaurant, come home, and do it all over again the next day. I feel like I'm not moving forward or achieving anything meaningful. It's just the same mundane routine day in and day out. And it's not like I don't try to break out of it. I've tried looking for other jobs but nothing really seems to click. It's like I'm stuck in this rut and I can't see a way out.",client,14,206
"Did you end up taking that public speaking class, by the way? I know you were looking at some options, but you were feeling pretty nervous about signing up.",therapist,15,206
"No, I haven't signed up yet. I looked into it, but I keep getting these waves of anxiety thinking about standing in front of a bunch of strangers and talking. It's almost paralyzing. But I know it's a step I need to take if I'm going to make any changes. It's just... really hard.",client,16,206
"Well, you've got some first-hand experience of how hard it is to make changes. And yet, here you are, thinking about some pretty big ones!",therapist,17,206
"I've been thinking about it a lot and I think I'd like to be an aerospace engineer. It's not exactly the same as a pilot but it's still in the same field, you know? The idea of designing aircrafts and spacecrafts, working on something that could potentially fly... it's exciting to me. But again, it's a huge step. I'll have to go back to school, study hard, and there's no guarantee of a job at the end of it. It's a lot to think about.",client,18,206
"Totally, I'd imagine that a career change like this would require a ton of work. Have you done any research into what it might take? Or are you still in the early stages of trying to decide?",therapist,19,206
"I've done a bit of research, yeah. I looked into what the job entails, what kind of education and experience I would need. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. There's so much I don't know, so much I'd need to learn. And then there's the financial aspect of it. Going back to school would be expensive, and I'm barely making ends meet as it is. It all just feels like a lot to take on. I want to do it, I really do, but I'm scared. I'm scared of failing, of not being good enough. I'm scared of investing time and money into this and then not being able to make it work. It's... it's a lot to",client,20,206
"Right, and the stakes feel high. You're in a tough spot, because on one hand, you're in a rut. But on the other hand, you're hesitant to spend so much time and money on a career change.",therapist,21,206
"Yeah, you're right. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know I can't stay where I am, but the thought of taking a leap into the unknown is terrifying. I mean, what if I end up failing? What if I'm not good enough? I want to believe that I can do it, but those doubts just keep creeping in.",client,22,206
"But at the very same time, doesn't it seem like you've achieved a lot, especially lately? You got a new job, and a new apartment, and you've been really persistent about meeting people. Maybe that stuff doesn't feel meaningful to you, but it's still proof that you're capable of handling change.",therapist,23,206
"You're right, I have made some changes lately. But sometimes it's hard to see those as achievements because they're not really tied to my passion, you know? They're just... things I needed to do. But I guess that doesn't make them any less valid. It's just scary, you know? The idea of committing to such a big change, and the fear of failing... It's a lot to take on.",client,24,206
