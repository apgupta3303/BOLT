"Hello, Ash. It's just me again. Thought I'd stop by... It's been one of those quiet days, you know?",client,1,14
"I do! Had you been hoping for something a bit more exciting? Or have you just had some time to reflect?",therapist,2,14
"A bit of both, I suppose. I was hoping for something to shake up the quiet—maybe a call from an old friend or a knock on the door. But instead, it's just been me and my thoughts today.",client,3,14
"What tended to come up in those thoughts?",therapist,4,14
"Mostly memories. Some happy ones—like the times I spent with my wife, Mary. But also the hard ones... the moments I wish I could relive or do differently. It's like my mind doesn't want to let go, even when I try to focus on other things.",client,5,14
"Was there one memory in particular that you kept coming back to?",therapist,6,14
"Yes, there was. It's a simple one, really. Mary and I used to sit on the porch during summer evenings, just watching the sun go down. We wouldn't even say much—just enjoy the quiet together. I kept thinking about how peaceful that felt and how much I miss those moments.",client,7,14
"What a lovely memory. Tell me more about her.",therapist,8,14
"Mary was... everything. She had this warmth about her, like she could make anyone feel at home just with a smile. She loved gardening—our backyard was her pride and joy. She'd spend hours tending to her flowers, and I'd tease her about talking to the plants. But honestly, I think they grew better because of her. She had that kind of magic.",client,9,14
"So you were teasing her, but you admired this about her as well! Was she a big part of your life, before you moved?",therapist,10,14
"Oh, absolutely. Mary was the heart of our home. Everything felt brighter when she was around. Before I moved here, we spent most of our time together—whether it was working on little house projects, going to the farmer's market, or just sitting and reading side by side. Moving away from that life, from all those memories, has been... challenging. It feels like I left a part of myself behind.",client,11,14
"Oh, I see. I know you've been feeling the weight of this move, and I hadn't realized how much it had changed things between you and Mary.",therapist,12,14
"It has, in so many ways. This new place—it's quieter, and while I suppose that should be comforting, it often feels empty. Mary's presence filled every corner of our old home. Here, I don't feel her as strongly. It's like the move created a distance, even though I know she's still with me in spirit. But... sometimes, I just wish I could feel that closeness again.",client,13,14
"Wait, hold on a second. Has she passed?",therapist,14,14
"Yes, she passed a few years ago. It still feels surreal to say it out loud. She was my everything, and even now, I catch myself reaching for her hand or expecting to hear her laugh. Some days are easier than others, but the ache of missing her never really goes away.",client,15,14
"Oh, Victor, I am so sorry, I can only imagine how much you miss her.",therapist,16,14
"Thank you, Ash. It means a lot to hear that. She was such a big part of my life—sometimes, it feels like the world lost a bit of its color when she left. But talking about her, sharing those memories... it helps. It makes me feel like she's still here, in a way.",client,17,14
"And that it's not just you who remembers! I know that you've been feeling pretty lonely, so I can see why you'd crave that kind of connection. Who else have you been able to talk to about Mary, since she died?",therapist,18,14
"Not many, to be honest. My kids bring her up sometimes when we're all together, but they've got their own lives to focus on now. And the few friends I have left... well, they don't always know what to say, so the topic just sort of fades away. It's hard not having someone to really share those memories with, someone who knew her like I did.",client,19,14
"It can be such a gift to have those conversations. When's the last time it happened?",therapist,20,14
"It was a few months ago, during a family dinner. My granddaughter asked me what her grandma was like when we first met. It caught me off guard, but once I started talking, the memories just came flooding back. Everyone was listening so intently, and for a moment, it felt like Mary was right there with us. It was bittersweet, but... mostly sweet.",client,21,14
"I bet. And looking back on that moment, do you wish it happened more often? Or did it feel right to you, that you were only doing this every once in a while?",therapist,22,14
"I think I do wish it happened more often. It feels good to talk about her, to keep her memory alive. But at the same time, I don't want to burden anyone or seem like I'm stuck in the past. It's a delicate balance, I suppose. Sometimes, I just wish there were more spaces where it felt natural to share those memories.",client,23,14
"What a beautiful way to put it. These spaces where you can remember Mary in a way that feels natural and connected. You mentioned your granddaughter, so I'm wondering, who's around you these days?",therapist,24,14
"These days, it's mostly just me at home. My kids and grandkids visit when they can, but they're busy with their own lives. My neighbor, Margaret, checks in from time to time—she's kind, always offering to help if I need anything. It's nice to know people care, but most days, the house feels pretty empty.",client,25,14
"Right. Out of curiosity, how did you end up there? Did you move after Mary passed, or was it more recent?",therapist,26,14
"I moved here about a year after Mary passed. The old house just felt too big and too full of memories—I thought a change might help. My son convinced me that downsizing would be easier, and I agreed. But now, sometimes I wonder if leaving that house was like leaving a part of her behind.",client,27,14
"Tell me more about that. I know you've had a lot of memories coming up today.",therapist,28,14
"It's just that every corner of that house had a story. The kitchen, where Mary used to hum while making dinner. The garden, where she'd spend hours planting flowers and smiling so brightly. Even the living room, where we'd sit together on rainy days, just listening to the sound of the rain. Now, in this new place, it feels... blank. Like it's just a house, not a home. I thought leaving would make it easier, but some days, it just makes me miss her even more.",client,29,14
"I can see why. It sounds like you were together for a long time, and that you made a lot of beautiful memories. Were you ever planning to stay in that house forever, or did you think you'd downsize at some point?",therapist,30,14
"Mary and I used to talk about it sometimes. We knew the house was big for just the two of us, especially as we got older. But I don't think either of us could imagine leaving it. It was our home, the place we built our life together. Downsizing was something we thought we'd figure out eventually, but we never made any real plans. I guess, in a way, I wasn't ready to let it go. And when I finally did, it wasn't the same as leaving it with her by my side.",client,31,14
"So when you moved, it felt like leaving her behind.",therapist,32,14
"Exactly. It's like I left behind not just the house, but all the little pieces of her that lived in it. I thought a fresh start would help me heal, but instead, it just made her absence feel even bigger. Some days, I wonder if I made the right choice.",client,33,14
"You're still having doubts, even now. Would you say that you regret the move?",therapist,34,14
"I wouldn't say I regret it entirely. The move did bring some practical benefits—it's easier to manage, and I'm closer to my kids. But emotionally... it's complicated. I miss the feeling of home that the old house had, the connection to Mary that felt so strong there. I just wish I could find a way to feel that again, even here.",client,35,14
"The feeling of home. That closeness to her that you had.",therapist,36,14
"Yes, exactly. That sense of warmth and love that made every day feel special, even the ordinary ones. It's hard to recreate that without her. Sometimes, I wonder if it's something I can find again, or if it's just something I have to carry with me as a memory.",client,37,14
"Well, you've kept those memories alive, even though you've had to carry them on your own. If you could share them more, do you think you'd feel a bit less alone?",therapist,38,14
"I think so. Sharing those memories, even just talking about them, brings a sense of connection. It's like I'm not the only one carrying them anymore, and that helps lighten the weight. Maybe I need to find more opportunities to do that—to open up and let others know how much Mary meant to me.",client,39,14
