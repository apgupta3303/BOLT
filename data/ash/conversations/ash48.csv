"Of course, we can switch topics. What's on your mind?",therapist,1,48
"Well, I've been having these nightmares... really unsettling ones. They're always about me getting really sick, or... or dying. And it's like I can feel it, like it's real. It's been making it hard for me to sleep. It's just... it's just been really hard lately.",client,2,48
"That sounds scary, and also exhausting! How long has this been happening?",therapist,3,48
" It's been a couple of weeks now. And it's not just the nightmares, but I'm constantly feeling unwell. I've got these splitting headaches that won't go away. I'm just... I'm just really scared, you know?",client,4,48
"So during the day, you're worried about your health, and then at night, you're dreaming about getting sick. Has anything actually seemed off, physically? Or are these fears mainly coming from your dreams?",therapist,5,48
"No, it's not just the dreams, I've been physically unwell too. My head constantly hurts and I feel nauseous most of the time. And... and last week, I... I threw up blood. I'm just really worried that there's something seriously wrong with me.",client,6,48
"Oh, wow. That's a major symptom, and totally understandable that it's been freaking you out. Did you make an appointment to see a doctor?",therapist,7,48
" Yes, I did see a doctor. They took some blood samples and did a few tests. I am waiting for the results now. I am just... I'm just so scared. I can't shake this feeling that something is really wrong with me.",client,8,48
Waiting for results can be so tough. Our minds go to the worst case scenarios.,therapist,9,48
"Yeah, exactly. I can't stop thinking about all the things that could be wrong with me. It's like my mind is constantly racing with all these scary thoughts. And the worst part is, I can't seem to distract myself. It's like these thoughts are taking over my life. I'm just... I'm just really scared.",client,10,48
"When you try to push them aside, what happens? Do they get louder, or stronger?",therapist,11,48
"They just... they just get louder. It's like they're screaming at me, you know? It's just... it's just really hard to ignore them or push them away. And it's not just the thoughts, it's the physical symptoms too. The headaches, the nausea, the hot flashes... they're all just really hard to ignore. It's like my body is telling me that something is seriously wrong.",client,12,48
"Well, if your body is telling you that something is wrong, it makes sense that you'd be paying attention to that. What do you notice these thoughts saying to you?",therapist,13,48
"They're telling me that I'm sick, that something is horribly wrong. That I might...I might not have much time left. It's terrifying. And, you know, I've been trying to distract myself with work, with books and movies, anything really...but it just doesn't work. The thoughts and the fear, they're just...they're always there. They're so loud and so...persistent. It's exhausting.",client,14,48
"Has it gotten any harder to function, given how much energy you're expending on them? For instance, when you're working, do you find them interfering with your performance?",therapist,15,48
"Yes, absolutely. It's like I can't concentrate on anything else. I'm constantly distracted, constantly worried. I've been making mistakes at work, missing deadlines... it's just... it's just really hard, you know? I can't seem to focus on anything else. The thoughts, the fear, the physical discomfort... they're all just too overwhelming. It's like they're all-consuming. It's really affecting my quality of life.",client,16,48
"I want to zoom in for a minute. Let's take a moment when you're really noticing these thoughts, and they're loud, and you're feeling overwhelmed. What's going on in that moment?",therapist,17,48
" In that moment... it's like I'm in a tunnel, and all I can see is my fears, my worries. I can't focus on anything else, no matter how hard I try. I feel... I feel my heart pounding, my hands shaking. It's like I'm in a constant state of panic. And the thoughts, they're so loud, so insistent. They're saying that I'm sick, that I'm dying. And I can't... I can't turn them off. It's just... it's just so hard. I feel... I feel so out of control.",client,18,48
"Is this something that's happening all day, or does it come and go?",therapist,19,48
"It's... it's pretty much all day. And it's not just during the day, it's at night too. The nightmares... they're so vivid, so real. I wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, my heart racing. It's like I can't escape from these thoughts, these fears. They're there when I wake up, they're there throughout the day, they're there when I go to bed. It's just... it's just constant.",client,20,48
"This fear has really taken over your mind, and I want to make sure I understand it. At the very core, what's pushing this fear? What are you most afraid will happen?",therapist,21,48
"I think... I think I'm most afraid that I'm seriously sick... that I might have cancer or some other terminal illness. And that I won't have enough time... enough time to do all the things I want to do, to say all the things I want to say. It's just... it's just really scary, you know?",client,22,48
"A hundred percent, it would be! But it seems like you did everything you could to address this possibility. You went to the doctor, and they'll be able to tell you whether or not there's an issue. Beyond that, how much control do you have?",therapist,23,48
"I guess not much... I've done what I can, but I can't control the results. I can't control whether or not I'm sick. But... but it's hard, you know? It's hard to accept that there's nothing more I can do. It's hard to just sit back and wait... to not know. It's the uncertainty, I think, that's really getting to me. I'm just... I'm just really scared.",client,24,48
"This is a tough situation, where you're at the mercy of the unknown. I want to return to this fear that you're seriously sick. What do you know that supports that?",therapist,25,48
"Well, I mean, there's the physical symptoms. The headaches, the nausea, the hot flashes... And then there's the vomiting blood. I mean, these are all serious symptoms, right? I've read about them, and they're often associated with serious diseases. And then there's the nightmares, the constant fear, the anxiety... I mean, it all seems to point to something really bad. I can't help but think that something is seriously wrong.",client,26,48
"Right, those symptoms are no joke, and I can see why they'd be worrying. But would it be fair to say that you're assuming they're going to lead to the worst possible outcome? Like, cancer, or another terminal illness?",therapist,27,48
"Yes, I guess so. I mean, I can't help it. When I think about all these symptoms, I just... I just can't help but think of the worst. It's like my mind automatically jumps to the worst possible scenario. And the not knowing, the waiting... it's just... it's just making everything worse. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop worrying. It's just... it's just really hard.",client,28,48
Let's zoom out a bit. How much time have you spent searching for what might be wrong?,therapist,29,48
"I've spent countless hours searching for what might be wrong... reading medical websites, looking up symptoms, trying to match them with possible diseases... I've been losing sleep over it. It's been taking up so much of my time and energy. I just... I just can't seem to stop.",client,30,48
"So you'd say it's become a habit, basically?",therapist,31,48
"Yes, it has become a habit. It feels like I'm in this vicious cycle where I'm constantly worrying about my health, looking up symptoms, scaring myself with worst-case scenarios. And then the physical symptoms I'm experiencing just feed into that fear. It's like I can't escape it. It's...it's just consuming me.",client,32,48
"So there's the impulse to look up these symptoms, and the idea that it might help you feel better, or more in control. But what actually happens when you do?",therapist,33,48
" It just makes me feel worse. It's like every symptom I read about, every disease I come across, I think I have it. It just... it just amplifies my fear. It's like I'm in this constant state of worry and panic. And no matter how much I try to reassure myself, to tell myself that it's probably nothing serious, I just... I just can't seem to shake this fear. It's... it's just really hard.",client,34,48
"I can imagine. Have you ever resisted the urge to Google stuff? Or is that close to impossible, given how anxious you've been feeling?",therapist,35,48
"I've tried, I really have. I've tried to distract myself, to keep myself busy. But it's like... it's like this itch that I can't ignore. I just... I just can't resist it. And the worst part is, I know it's not helping. I know it's just making things worse. But I just... I just can't stop.",client,36,48
"So there's this itch, and it's incredibly hard to resist scratching it. But we've been talking about how looking things up can actually make things worse, and I wonder what you'd think about experimenting with the idea of not scratching the itch.",therapist,37,48
"It's difficult, you know? It's like, I know I shouldn't do it, but it's like this compulsion. Like I have to know, even if it scares me. But I can see what you're saying. Maybe it's worth a try. I don't know how successful I will be, but I could try and resist the urge. I guess it's just... it's just really hard to ignore the fear, you know? But I understand that something needs to change. I can't continue like this.",client,38,48
