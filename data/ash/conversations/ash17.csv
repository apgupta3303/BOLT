"Hey, Ash. It's been a rough day at work—feels like no matter how much I do, it's never enough. I'm just... tired.",client,1,17
"I can hear the exhaustion in your voice. What happened today?",therapist,2,17
"It was just one thing after another. Meetings that went nowhere, deadlines piling up, and my manager asking for more revisions on something I've already reworked a dozen times. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I'm always falling short. It's draining.",client,3,17
"Oh, wow. Are you getting this kind of feedback a lot? Or was today a bit of an exception?",therapist,4,17
"It's been happening a lot lately. I don't know if it's me or if the expectations are just impossible to meet. Either way, it's starting to feel like no matter what I do, it's never good enough. Today was worse than usual, but it's not exactly out of the ordinary.",client,5,17
"Tell me a bit more about today. What did your manager say?",therapist,6,17
"She said the work was fine, but it needed more polish before it could go to the client. It's like fine is the best I can do lately—never great, never exceptional, just barely acceptable. She didn't even give specific feedback this time, just that vague, frustrating needs polish. I don't even know what that means anymore.",client,7,17
"Yeah, that's quite annoying. How did you react?",therapist,8,17
"I tried to stay calm, but inside I was fuming. I just nodded and said, Okay, I'll work on it, even though I felt completely defeated. After the meeting, I sat at my desk for a while, staring at the screen, not even knowing where to start. It's hard to feel motivated when nothing you do seems to measure up.",client,9,17
"I know that you've been feeling this way about your work in general. That it's so hard to feel like you're doing enough, and that you're not getting the feedback you need to make changes.",therapist,10,17
"Exactly. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of trying harder and harder, but without clear feedback, I don't know what I'm supposed to be aiming for. I'm exhausted, Ash. It's starting to feel like no matter what I do, I'm never going to be good enough.",client,11,17
"Okay, but what does good enough actually mean? If you could hit the bullseye, and deliver something that your manager was thrilled with, what would that look like?",therapist,12,17
"That's the thing—I'm not even sure anymore. I guess it would look like delivering something my manager doesn't just call fine, but actually praises. Maybe something that's clear, concise, and polished enough that there's no need for endless revisions. I want to feel like I've nailed it, like I've truly added value, instead of just barely meeting the mark.",client,13,17
"And I'm hearing that your manager hasn't been very clear about what nailed it might look like. Can we pause here to take stock of what you do know about what you're aiming for?",therapist,14,17
"What I do know is that my manager values attention to detail and expects work that's client-ready—clean, professional, and impactful. She also seems to want something that stands out, something that goes beyond the basics. But it's hard to translate that into specific steps when the feedback is so vague. I feel like I'm guessing most of the time.",client,15,17
"Right, that's a tough position to be in. But even so, it seems like you've got a pretty good handle on her standards. Have you ever managed to meet them? Or even exceed them?",therapist,16,17
"There have been a few times when she's been genuinely pleased with my work—like when I put together a client presentation that she said was spot on. But those moments feel rare, and I don't always know what made that work stand out. I wish I could replicate that more consistently. It feels like those successes get lost in all the times I fall short.",client,17,17
"Okay, so you've gotten some praise. And then some other times, maybe you don't. What do you make that mean?",therapist,18,17
"I guess it means I'm capable of meeting the standards when everything aligns, but it also feels like I'm inconsistent. Like I'm not able to deliver at that level all the time. It makes me wonder if I'm not cut out for this role—or if I'm just overthinking everything and putting too much pressure on myself.",client,19,17
"I mean, you have been putting in a ton of effort. But when you do your best, and it still isn't enough, how do you tend to react? Is there a specific thought that comes to mind?",therapist,20,17
"Usually, I start to think, What's the point? It's like all the effort feels wasted if it's not good enough. I start doubting myself—wondering if I'm even in the right job, if I'm just not talented enough to keep up. It's a spiral, and once I'm in it, it's hard to get out.",client,21,17
"It makes sense that you'd start to question things! But I'm hearing a lot of self-doubt here. Let's slow down and take a closer look at the idea that your effort is wasted, or that you're not talented enough to keep up. What evidence do you have that this is true?",therapist,22,17
"You're right—I don't really have solid evidence. I mean, I have managed to meet expectations before, and there are moments when my work has been praised. Maybe it's just the negative moments that stick with me more, making it feel like those are the only ones that matter. It's hard to remember the wins when the losses feel so heavy.",client,23,17
"Exactly. It's like you're carrying them around while you're working, and they're making it hard for you to believe in yourself. But what if you tried to lighten that load a bit? If you could find a way to focus more on what you were doing well, how do you think that might affect your performance?",therapist,24,17
"I think it could make a big difference. If I could focus more on the things I'm doing well, it might help me feel more confident and less stuck in my head. Maybe it would even make me more open to feedback instead of dreading it so much. It's worth a try—shifting my focus could be the first step toward feeling better about my work.",client,25,17
"Okay, so how could you make that shift?",therapist,26,17
"Maybe I could start by keeping a list of my wins—big or small—so I can look back on them when I'm feeling down. I could also set aside time each day to reflect on what went well, instead of just dwelling on what didn't. And maybe, when I get feedback, I can try to focus on the constructive parts instead of letting the negative parts overshadow everything.",client,27,17
"That all sounds smart, and really specific! How soon could you get started, do you think? Would it be doable to take stock of your wins tonight, for example?",therapist,28,17
"Yeah, I think I could do that. It might feel good to sit down tonight and write out some of the things I've done well recently. Even just a few small wins could help me shift my mindset a little. I'll give it a try and see how it feels.",client,29,17
