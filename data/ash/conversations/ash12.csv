"Hey, Ash. I've been feeling kind of lost lately. It's like I'm stuck in my own head, trying to figure out who I really am, and I don't even know where to start. It's... a lot.",client,1,12
"When you say you're lost, is it more that you don't know what you want, or that you're not sure how you come across to other people?",therapist,2,12
"It's kind of both, I think. I'm not totally sure what I want or who I am yet, and it feels like other people have already figured me out before I even say anything. It's like they put me in a box I'm not sure I fit into. That makes it even harder to figure myself out.",client,3,12
"That's so frustrating, to feel like you're getting labeled or categorized before you even get the chance to speak. What box are people putting you in?",therapist,4,12
"Mostly the box of who they think I should be—like, based on how I look or how they've always known me. It's like people see me a certain way and assume I'm comfortable with it, but I'm not sure I am. I want to explore who I really am, but I feel stuck because of their expectations.",client,5,12
"Got it. And who are these people, exactly? Have you been hearing this from your friends, or your family?",therapist,6,12
"It's a bit of both. My friends don't say much directly, but I can tell they expect me to be the same person I've always been. My family, though... they make comments about how I should act or dress, and it feels like they don't even realize how much it hurts. It's like they don't see me at all.",client,7,12
"What are some of the comments that have hurt?",therapist,8,12
"It's little things, like my mom saying, 'You look so nice in that dress', when I don't even feel comfortable wearing it. Or my dad making jokes about how I should be more 'ladylike.' They're not trying to be mean, but it feels like they don't understand how I see myself—or how I want to be seen. It just makes me feel... invisible.",client,9,12
"I can see why. If you had to name one thing you'd like them to understand, what would it be?",therapist,10,12
"I'd want them to understand that I'm still figuring things out, and that's okay. I don't need them to have all the answers—I just need them to support me while I try to find my own. If they could just listen and accept me without trying to fit me into a mold, that would mean so much.",client,11,12
"I hear that. And I want to take a second to appreciate the fact that you are in a moment of exploration right now. That can be a really powerful place to be! If you could learn or explore anything about yourself, what would you want to discover?",therapist,12,12
"I think I'd want to discover what really feels right for me—how I want to present myself to the world and who I am deep down. I want to figure out what makes me feel comfortable and authentic, instead of just going along with what others expect. It's scary, but also exciting to think about.",client,13,12
"It is! And I know your family has been pushing you to act a certain way, but what's felt authentic so far? Have there been any moments where you've been able to let your guard down, and just do what you wanted?",therapist,14,12
"Yeah, there have been a few moments. Like, when I'm with my closest friend, I feel like I can just be myself without worrying about how I look or act. And sometimes, when I'm alone, I'll experiment with clothes or hairstyles that feel more 'me.' Those moments feel freeing, like I'm getting closer to who I want to be.",client,15,12
"I love that. What does 'more you' look like?",therapist,16,12
"'More me' feels like being comfortable in my own skin—maybe wearing clothes that aren't so traditionally feminine or trying out a more neutral style. It's also about how I carry myself, feeling confident in who I am rather than trying to fit into someone else's idea of who I should be. It's hard to describe, but it feels lighter, freer.",client,17,12
"And does it ever feel the opposite? Like, heavy or constrained?",therapist,18,12
"Yeah, definitely. It feels heavy when I'm trying to be what other people expect—like wearing something I don't like or acting in a way that doesn't feel right. It's like I'm carrying this invisible weight, and I can't fully relax or just be myself. Those moments make me feel small, like I'm trapped in someone else's version of me.",client,19,12
"And you've been wearing that weight for a while now. As you think about this feeling of being trapped, what does it bring up for you?",therapist,20,12
"It brings up frustration, mostly. Like, why do I have to carry this weight just to make other people comfortable? But it also makes me sad, because I want to feel free to be myself, and right now it feels like I'm stuck hiding parts of who I am. It's exhausting, and sometimes I wonder if it'll ever get easier.",client,21,12
"I get that. If you could do one thing to make it easier, what would it be? You mentioned that you sometimes experiment with your style when you're alone, so maybe you'd want to take that a step further?",therapist,22,12
"I think taking it a step further would mean trying out that style around people I trust—like my closest friend. It's scary to think about, but maybe it would help me feel more comfortable being myself. If I could start small, with someone I know will support me, it might be a good first step.",client,23,12
"You've got this big sense of what feels more like you. And you're wanting to try it out - there's some trepidation, but also some excitement.",therapist,24,12
"Yeah, that's exactly it. I'm nervous, but I'm also excited about the possibility of finally feeling more like myself. It feels like a big step, but I think it could be really freeing if I can take that leap. It's scary, but in a good way.",client,25,12
"Well, what if you didn't take it all at once? You've been testing the waters by yourself, so why not keep doing that, and figure out when you might want to take things public? There wouldn't be any rush!",therapist,26,12
"That actually makes a lot of sense. I like the idea of taking my time and not putting pressure on myself to do everything all at once. I can keep experimenting on my own and figure out what feels right before I share it with anyone else. It feels less overwhelming that way.",client,27,12
"And it sounds like you really want to share it with someone. Just to get a bit of validation, or to hear what they think.",therapist,28,12
"Yeah, I do want to share it with someone eventually. I think hearing what they think—especially if it's someone I trust—would help me feel more confident about taking steps toward being myself. It's scary to think about, but it also feels like it could be really validating.",client,29,12
