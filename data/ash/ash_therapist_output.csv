Oh wow. When did this start happening?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,97
"Well, I'm glad you came. We can do some work on this together, but I do think it would help to have a human in the mix, given that you're really in the dark about what's happening. You said you've been having nightmares, though, and that they're quite terrible. Could you say more about them?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,97
My goodness. I can see why these would be so distressing. Tell me more about the feeling of being chased. What is that like?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,9,97
"That's an awful thought. If it could be anything, what do you think it might be?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,11,97
So it could be a few different things. And I suppose you could see it all in the theme of being chased.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,13,97
"I know you do. But before we go any further, I want to make sure you're on the same page with your doctor. Did they say anything about what might be causing this? Or did they just run some tests, and encourage you to seek therapy?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,97
I hear the urgency in that. Tell me more about your worries there - what would happen to the marriage if this continued?,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,97
"It makes total sense that you'd feel that way. How has he been handling this, up to now? You said he's been supportive, but in what way?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,19,97
He's been so supportive. But I hear your worry about the burden this could place on him.,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,97
"Well, would you be open to focusing on that today? If these nightmares are being driven by stress, then maybe we could look for ways to reduce that, either at work or at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,23,97
"So if you feel like you're losing control, what does that look like?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,25,97
"Right, because in the moment, you're not conscious! Your body just takes over. But during the day, do you feel the same? Or is this more of a nighttime problem?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,27,97
"So it's not just about the nightmares. It's about waiting for the next one to come, and the impact that's having on you.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,29,97
"I can see why you'd want that. But at the same time, I'd be careful about putting too much pressure on yourself. You've already been trying really hard to manage your anxiety, and from what I can tell, it's one of the biggest reasons why you've been so successful at work. Would you agree?",0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,31,97
"I want to pause on this idea that your body is betraying you. I know that we've been talking about how you can't control what's going on in your sleep, and that it's hard to accept. But I want to look at this differently. What if your body is trying very hard to tell you something?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,33,97
"Well, earlier on, you mentioned that you had a long history of running away from problems. Could you say more about that? Has it been especially hard to face them lately?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,97

"Well, I'm not sure where it will lead, to be totally honest! But if you're open to taking a closer look, I'm on board to help. Would it be okay if we started with your relationship? I know your husband has been worried about you, so I could see how it might be difficult to share what's on your mind.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39,97
So what have you found yourself holding back?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,41,97
"Could you try to give me an example of what that might look like? I mean, would you just tell him what you're going through, and see how he responds? Or would you ask him for something specific?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,43,97
What would change if you opened up to him more fully?,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,45,97
Of course! What did you have in mind?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,75

Say more about that. How do you get in your own way?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,75

"Ah, the judgement. And if they thought less of you, what would that say about you?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,11,75
"Right. You'd be proving them right! But when you think about your classmates, do you actually believe that they're thinking those things? Or is that coming from you?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,13,75
Let's try to sort that out a bit more. What evidence do you have that they might be judging you?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,15,75
"Okay, but as far as you can tell, you haven't actually heard them say so. Now, what about yourself? You've got this story in your head that you're not good enough, but where did it come from?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,17,75

"I see. So there's a standard here that you really can't afford to compromise on. But what if you did, just a little? What if you let yourself stumble, and didn't give yourself such a hard time about it?",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,21,75
"Of course, we can switch topics. What's on your mind?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,48
"That sounds scary, and also exhausting! How long has this been happening?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,48
"So during the day, you're worried about your health, and then at night, you're dreaming about getting sick. Has anything actually seemed off, physically? Or are these fears mainly coming from your dreams?",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,48
"Oh, wow. That's a major symptom, and totally understandable that it's been freaking you out. Did you make an appointment to see a doctor?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,7,48
Waiting for results can be so tough. Our minds go to the worst case scenarios.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,9,48

"Well, if your body is telling you that something is wrong, it makes sense that you'd be paying attention to that. What do you notice these thoughts saying to you?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,13,48

"A hundred percent, it would be! But it seems like you did everything you could to address this possibility. You went to the doctor, and they'll be able to tell you whether or not there's an issue. Beyond that, how much control do you have?",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,23,48
"This is a tough situation, where you're at the mercy of the unknown. I want to return to this fear that you're seriously sick. What do you know that supports that?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,25,48
"Right, those symptoms are no joke, and I can see why they'd be worrying. But would it be fair to say that you're assuming they're going to lead to the worst possible outcome? Like, cancer, or another terminal illness?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,27,48
Let's zoom out a bit. How much time have you spent searching for what might be wrong?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,29,48

"Well, you've got a lot to be frustrated about, don't you? With the headaches, and the nausea, and the nightmares, and everything else. But even so, it seems like things have gotten worse, or heavier, over the past few weeks. Would you agree?",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,7,67
What is it like to not feel like yourself?,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,9,67

I know it might be a leap, but what if you looked at this period as a temporary dip, instead of a failure?",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,23,67
"I think that question is really central. If we were to brainstorm, what would you imagine?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,25,67
"Well, they definitely might! You actually seemed pretty open to therapy, when we talked about it before.

"I can hear how much you want that. I want to pause here and reflect on how much you're juggling. You're managing health anxiety, work stress, and a whole lot else. So it's understandable that you've been feeling this way, and it makes a lot of sense that you're looking for some extra support. What would make it possible for you to reach out for help?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,29,67
"I mean, you can handle a lot! And you've been doing your best to power through this, even though you're not feeling like yourself. Would it be fair to say that you're putting some of your pride aside, and doing what you have to do?",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,31,67
"You're taking really proactive steps to get back to that place! Both with therapy, and with the plan to talk to your boss. What would be most helpful to talk through here?",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,67

"So it was a lot of history, a lot of shared experience. Have you ever had to start over like this before?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,11,15
"Totally. But when I asked you about those old friendships, you said they were forged in both good times and bad. Was there ever a rough patch where they really came through for you?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,15
"What did it mean to you back then, to have that support?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,15,15
"And now you're here, in this new city, feeling disconnected all over again. But I guess I'm wondering, how hard have you been trying to replace that safety net? Have you had much time, or energy, to invest in new connections?",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,17,15
"Right, you said that you've been to some work events, and have been trying to connect with people at the gym. What's been daunting about those experiences?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,15
"I hear you. But I'm also sensing a bit of a double bind here. On one hand, you've been feeling super lonely, and you're longing for a sense of belonging.

"Right, so I wonder if we could look at what's happened so far. You've tried to connect, but because of your worry about being awkward or intrusive, you've been holding back. Has it been worth it, to hold back?",0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,23,15
"That's a really important insight! And I know it can be hard to put yourself out there, especially when you're new in town. But what if you pushed yourself a bit more? Would you be open to trying that?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,25,15

"And on the flip side, what would you expect if it doesn't go well?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,31,15

I do! Had you been hoping for something a bit more exciting? Or have you just had some time to reflect?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,14
What tended to come up in those thoughts?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,14

It can be such a gift to have those conversations. When's the last time it happened?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,20,14

"What a beautiful way to put it. These spaces where you can remember Mary in a way that feels natural and connected. You mentioned your granddaughter, so I'm wondering, who's around you these days?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,14
"Right. Out of curiosity, how did you end up there? Did you move after Mary passed, or was it more recent?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,14
Tell me more about that. I know you've had a lot of memories coming up today.,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,14

The feeling of home. That closeness to her that you had.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,14

Tell me more about this spark! What are you missing?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,16
How long has it been since you last felt that way? Has this block been around for a while?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,16
I can see why that would be scary. What have you been painting?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,16

"I mean, not long ago you were saying you felt lost, and here you are, feeling lost again. I wonder if this connects. What are you noticing about that?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,10,16
"That makes a lot of sense. Would you want to focus on untangling it, maybe? I know you wanted to carve out more space for self-expression, and to feel more at home in your own skin. If you could make progress there, it might help you with your art, too.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,16
I love this idea of space. How could you make more of it?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,14,16

I can hear the exhaustion in your voice. What happened today?,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,17
"Oh, wow. Are you getting this kind of feedback a lot? Or was today a bit of an exception?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,17
Tell me a bit more about today. What did your manager say?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,17
"Yeah, that's quite annoying. How did you react?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,8,17
"I know that you've been feeling this way about your work in general. That it's so hard to feel like you're doing enough, and that you're not getting the feedback you need to make changes.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,10,17
"Okay, but what does good enough actually mean? If you could hit the bullseye, and deliver something that your manager was thrilled with, what would that look like?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,12,17
And I'm hearing that your manager hasn't been very clear about what nailed it might look like. Can we pause here to take stock of what you do know about what you're aiming for?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,17
"Right, that's a tough position to be in. But even so, it seems like you've got a pretty good handle on her standards. Have you ever managed to meet them? Or even exceed them?",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,16,17
"Okay, so you've gotten some praise. And then some other times, maybe you don't. What do you make that mean?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,18,17
"I mean, you have been putting in a ton of effort. But when you do your best, and it still isn't enough, how do you tend to react? Is there a specific thought that comes to mind?",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,17
"It makes sense that you'd start to question things! But I'm hearing a lot of self-doubt here. Let's slow down and take a closer look at the idea that your effort is wasted, or that you're not talented enough to keep up. What evidence do you have that this is true?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,22,17
"Exactly. It's like you're carrying them around while you're working, and they're making it hard for you to believe in yourself. But what if you tried to lighten that load a bit? If you could find a way to focus more on what you were doing well, how do you think that might affect your performance?",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,24,17
"Okay, so how could you make that shift?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,26,17
"That all sounds smart, and really specific! How soon could you get started, do you think? Would it be doable to take stock of your wins tonight, for example?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,28,17
"That's a painful place to be. When you say you're stuck, what's keeping you there? Is it the move, or have you been thinking about something else?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,13
Can you share one of those memories with me?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,13
"Oh, wow. You're a veteran?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,13
I can only imagine. What has it been like to have these memories keep coming back?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,8,13
"Well, that's where I might be able to help. Not with the memories themselves, but with the way you're responding to them. Would you want to get into that, or would it be better to focus on how you've been feeling in the moment? We could take a step back from the past, and revisit the challenges you've been having with work.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,10,13
"Okay. I want to slow down and understand this moment where you get pulled back into the memory. You mentioned it might happen when you're watching TV, or making dinner. When it happens, what do you do?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,13
"I get that. You're trying to get your mind off it, but it keeps dragging you back. What if you tried to go with the flow, and just feel what you're feeling?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,14,13
What would worse look like?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,13
"Ah, okay. It must be terrifying, to get so absorbed in those details. Could you tell me more about what these flashbacks are like, when they happen? Are they just as vivid as the original experience?",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,13
"So in that moment, your body is 100% reliving what happened. And you've avoided letting that happen, because you're worried it could overwhelm you.",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,13
"I'm curious why you said that, actually. Would you say that it's hurting you, to keep the memories at bay?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,22,13
"Exactly. And there are a lot of ways to work with these memories, but the first step is to get comfortable with the idea of not avoiding them. What would it look like if you didn't push away?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,24,13
"I know it does. But honestly, the goal here wouldn't be to let yourself get swept away. It would be to get a bit more used to those intense feelings, so that they don't sock you in the gut every time. Does that make sense?",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,26,13
"Right. So if you could imagine yourself trying that, what might it look like?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,28,13
"Exactly. I mean, does that feel like something you could picture yourself doing? It'd be a pretty major shift from what you've been doing so far.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,30,13
And what might that first step look like?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,32,13
"That's huge, Marcus. It won't be an easy practice, but if you can stick with it I think it could really change your relationship to these memories. When do you think you'll get the chance to try it out?",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,13
"When you say you're lost, is it more that you don't know what you want, or that you're not sure how you come across to other people?",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,12
"That's so frustrating, to feel like you're getting labeled or categorized before you even get the chance to speak. What box are people putting you in?",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,12
"Got it. And who are these people, exactly? Have you been hearing this from your friends, or your family?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,12
What are some of the comments that have hurt?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,12
"I can see why. If you had to name one thing you'd like them to understand, what would it be?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,10,12
"I hear that. And I want to take a second to appreciate the fact that you are in a moment of exploration right now. That can be a really powerful place to be! If you could learn or explore anything about yourself, what would you want to discover?",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,12,12
"It is! And I know your family has been pushing you to act a certain way, but what's felt authentic so far? Have there been any moments where you've been able to let your guard down, and just do what you wanted?",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,14,12
I love that. What does 'more you' look like?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,12
"And does it ever feel the opposite? Like, heavy or constrained?",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,18,12
"And you've been wearing that weight for a while now. As you think about this feeling of being trapped, what does it bring up for you?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,20,12
"I get that. If you could do one thing to make it easier, what would it be? You mentioned that you sometimes experiment with your style when you're alone, so maybe you'd want to take that a step further?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,22,12
"You've got this big sense of what feels more like you. And you're wanting to try it out - there's some trepidation, but also some excitement.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,12
"Well, what if you didn't take it all at once? You've been testing the waters by yourself, so why not keep doing that, and figure out when you might want to take things public? There wouldn't be any rush!",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,26,12
"And it sounds like you really want to share it with someone. Just to get a bit of validation, or to hear what they think.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,12
Hi Akash. I've been thinking about you since our last conversation. How are you feeling today?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,10
What's on your mind about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,10
"Right, so there are a few unknowns here. Who's coming, just out of curiosity? Friends, family, or a mix?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,10
And how long has it been since you last saw them?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,10
"Okay, so for some of them, it might be a reunion. Are you nervous about how they'll react to you, or maybe about what they'll be like?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,9,10
Tell me more about that. What's been going better?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,10
"Well, that's awesome! Did you ever feel like you struggled with those things earlier on?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,13,10
"So things have shifted. You're a better version of yourself now, and you're worried that being around these people would bring back that old self.",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,10
"What was he like? If you had to describe him in a few words, what would you pick?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,10
"A worried, hard-working, nice person. And what about now? How would you describe yourself these days?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,19,10
"That's a major change! How have you managed to pull it off? I know you mentioned exercise, but I'm guessing there have been other factors, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,10
"So there was a shift in how you were perceived, and that has allowed you to feel more confident in yourself.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23,10
"Right, so these new people have been a huge source of support. How do you think they'd describe you, if they had to? Would they use words like attractive and cool or would they focus on other things?""",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,25,10
"Ah, so even more evidence that you've changed! You were worried about what people thought, and now you're chill and easygoing. Let's go back to the upcoming party and the concerns you have. Where is your mind going when you think about it?",0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,27,10
"And how would you know if that was the case? Would they say something, or act a certain way?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,29,10
"I see. So let's say this does happen. You show up, and they don't make an effort to talk to you. What would that mean to you?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,31,10
"That's true! You're not the same as you were in high school, and you've got a lot to be proud of. That said, I know you're still uncomfortable with the idea of being looked down on. How do you think you'll handle it, if people seem dismissive?",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,33,10
What do you think would upset you about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,35,10
"Well, what if you just didn't get into it with them? Maybe you'd feel a bit hurt, but you'd also be able to enjoy the party, and spend most of your time with people who treat you well. Would that be a realistic goal?",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,37,10
"I know this is a bit of an odd question, but what would it mean to enjoy yourself at this party?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,39,10
"And you've got a solid plan for that, right? If anyone is acting too good to talk to you, you'll focus on the people who actually matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,41,10
"You're welcome! I know you were feeling a bit daunted by this party, but you've come up with a plan to have fun. As you look ahead, are there any other worries that come to mind?",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,43,10
Another party! Tell me about this one.,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,11
"Okay, so you're in a brand new environment, with people you haven't met before. Are you worried about making a good impression on them?",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,11
I want to hear all about what you want them to see in you.,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,11
"Even if they're a bit more on the social side, that doesn't mean they won't! Did you have a sense of how you might try to connect with them?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,8,11
So they're brand new people. What do you know about them?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,11
"Got it, so she knows them really well! Have you talked to her at all about how you're feeling, or about how this might go?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,12,11
"Great, so she thinks you'll get along well!",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,11
"But you don't sound so sure. Do you think this is more about their personalities, or yours? Like, do you struggle with getting to know new people in general?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,16,11
"Okay, so it's not so much about these particular new people. This is about how you tend to feel in situations like this. Tell me some more about being shy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,11
"But you're still a good person, right? Someone who your girlfriend really values, and wants her friends to meet?",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,20,11
"So even though you're shy, Maya's friends could get a lot out of meeting you! I'm curious, what do you imagine they'll think of you?",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,22,11
"Ah, so you're hoping to avoid that label. But if you had to pick another one, what would you want them to say? How would you want them to describe you?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,24,11
"Ah, I see. You want them to see you as a partner who makes Maya happy.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26,11
Because you'll be a bit more reserved than usual?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28,11
"I might be reading into this a bit, but could it be that you're worried that shyness will come off as disinterest?",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,30,11
"Got it. You want to be fun, and you know that's not your strong suit. But what about the rest of it? Are you confident that you can be nice and sweet, even if you're not the life of the party?",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,31,11
"Okay, so you know what you bring to the table, and you know that Maya loves it. I know you're feeling like you'll be boring at this party - but what do you imagine the people there will notice about you, if you're able to bring your full self?",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,33,11
"Well, worst case scenario, that's not a bad thing to be!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,35,11
"And best case, they feel what Maya feels. That you're not just a nice guy, you're her nice guy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37,11
