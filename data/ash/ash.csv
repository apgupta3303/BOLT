Sure thing. What direction would you like to take this?,therapist,1,20
"I think I just want to check in and make sure I'm staying on track. Things have been going well, but I want to keep growing and make sure I don't fall back into old habits. Maybe we can talk about ways to keep building on what's working?",client,2,20
"That's an amazing thing to prioritize, especially because you've been under so much pressure! What's been going well, just to start? I know you've been trying to adjust your mindset a bit, when it comes to school. Have you made any headway there, or have you been focused on other stuff?",therapist,3,20
"Things have been going pretty well! I've been keeping up with my journaling and using it to work through my thoughts before they become overwhelming. I've also been sticking to my exercise routine, which has really helped my energy levels. As for mindset, I've been trying to focus on being kinder to myself, and I think it's starting to pay off.",client,4,20
What does that kindness look like?,therapist,5,20
"It looks like giving myself permission to rest when I need it, instead of pushing through exhaustion. It's also about being more forgiving when I make mistakes—reminding myself that I'm doing my best and that it's okay not to be perfect.",client,6,20
"That's huge! Especially given what you were saying about failure. Weren't you worried that if you misstepped, people might start seeing you as incompetent?",therapist,7,20
"I was, and honestly, I still worry about that sometimes. But I've started to realize that most of the pressure is coming from me, not other people. The more I remind myself that everyone makes mistakes, the easier it's been to let go of that fear.",client,8,20
"So you have that fear, but you've been working on letting it go. Can you tell me about a time recently when you reminded yourself of that?",therapist,9,20
"Yeah, actually, last week at work, I made a small mistake in my code that caused a delay in our project. Normally, I would've beaten myself up about it for days, but this time I reminded myself that it happens to everyone. I fixed it, apologized, and moved on. It felt really freeing not to dwell on it.",client,10,20
"What did you notice afterwards? Were you able to focus more, or feel a bit more energized?",therapist,11,20
"I did! I felt like a weight had been lifted, and I was able to focus on the next task without carrying that mistake with me. It was energizing, and it made me realize how much time and energy I used to waste beating myself up.",client,12,20
"So not only did you get your energy back, you were able to move forward. It was very different from the downward spiral you were describing earlier.",therapist,13,20
"Exactly. It felt so different from how I used to handle things. I didn't get stuck overthinking or doubting myself, and I was able to keep moving forward without dragging that negativity along with me. It's a good change.",client,14,20
"Well, I think you've earned it! Feeling that weight on your shoulders must have been exhausting. But, thinking bigger picture, what do you think it would take to keep it off? You've made a lot of progress, but I know you haven't been doing this forever.",therapist,15,20
"I think it's going to take consistency—keeping up with the habits that have been working for me, like journaling and giving myself grace when I slip up. I also want to keep checking in with myself regularly to make sure I'm not falling back into old patterns. It's definitely a work in progress, but I feel like I'm on the right path.",client,16,20
What would a slip-up look like?,therapist,17,20
"A slip-up would probably look like falling back into overthinking or being too hard on myself after a mistake. Maybe skipping my journaling or letting my routines slide because I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's not the end of the world, but I'd want to catch it early and get back on track.",client,18,20
"Got it, so you'd need to catch yourself quickly. Would you want to practice that now, maybe? We could imagine a scenario where you make a mistake, and you feel the urge to dwell.",therapist,19,20
That sounds like a good idea. Let's say I accidentally missed an important email at work and caused a delay. My first instinct might be to spiral into self-doubt and overthinking. How would I catch myself and shift my focus in that moment?,client,20,20
"Let's start with what happens in the spiral. You miss the email, you realize you've done so, and what happens in your mind?",therapist,21,20
"I'd probably start thinking things like, 'How could I miss that? I should have been more careful.' Then it might spiral into, 'Now everyone will think I'm unreliable,' and 'What if I mess up again?' It's a cascade of self-doubt and imagining worst-case scenarios.",client,22,20
"Right, and you were able to break that pattern when you made the coding error. What did you say to yourself then?",therapist,23,20
"I reminded myself that mistakes happen to everyone and that one mistake doesn't define my abilities. I focused on fixing the error and moving forward, telling myself that what matters is how I handle the situation, not the fact that it happened.",client,24,20
So this is really interesting. Can I try to explain back what happened here?,therapist,25,20
Of course! I'd love to hear how you see it. Maybe it'll help me understand the pattern better.,client,26,20
"Well, on the one hand, you were admitting that what you'd done was wrong. But on the other, you were seeing it as a chance to improve. Did I get that right?",therapist,27,20
"Yes, exactly! I acknowledged the mistake without letting it define me, and I used it as a learning experience. It felt productive instead of defeating, which was a big shift for me.",client,28,20
How did you actually accomplish that shift in your mind?,therapist,29,20
"I think it started with recognizing that my initial reaction was driven by fear, not logic. Then I reminded myself that everyone makes mistakes and that what matters is how I respond. Focusing on the solution instead of the problem helped me shift my energy toward something constructive.",client,30,20
"Ah, okay. So you were moving towards something, as opposed to just running away from your fear. I wonder if you could do something similar in this new scenario, with the email. You might doubt yourself at first, but could you identify a positive step you could take?",therapist,31,20
"Definitely. In the email scenario, a positive step could be reaching out to the team to acknowledge the mistake and suggest a way to address the delay. I'd also double-check my system for tracking emails to prevent it from happening again. That way, I'm taking responsibility while also focusing on improvement.",client,32,20
"I love that. And I want to highlight something, which is that you've been working on being kinder to yourself. Before, you were having a thought like, 'I'm not good enough' and that was leading to a feeling of shame, and then a lot of spiraling. But in this coding scenario, you took a moment to remind yourself that mistakes happen to everyone. You were able to move on.",therapist,33,20
"Thank you for pointing that out. It's nice to see the progress I've made when you frame it like that. I've been trying to be more compassionate toward myself, and I guess it's starting to stick. It feels good to know I'm moving in the right direction.",client,34,20
"Hi Ash! Honestly, things are going pretty smoothly right now. Work is manageable, and I've been sticking to my routines. I just wanted to check in and make sure I'm not overlooking anything that could help me keep this balance long-term.",client,1,21
"I love that you're feeling good, and you're wanting to keep this going! Aside from work, what's been going well?",therapist,2,21
"Outside of work, things are great! I've been spending more time outdoors—hiking on weekends and trying out some new trails. I've also been making an effort to catch up with friends regularly, which has been really refreshing. It feels good to have a balance between work and personal life.",client,3,21
"Excellent. Were you feeling a bit off-balance before? I know you've had a lot to handle, from your workload to Mark's passing.",therapist,4,21
"Yeah, I definitely was. Mark's passing hit me hard, and for a while, it felt like I was just going through the motions. Work piled up, and I didn't make much time for myself or my relationships. It's taken effort, but I feel like I've found my footing again, which is a relief.",client,5,21
I'm so glad to hear that. What do you think has been making the biggest difference?,therapist,6,21
"I think it's been a combination of things. Making time to connect with friends and family has really helped me feel supported, and spending time in nature has been grounding. I've also been more intentional about setting boundaries at work, which has given me the space to focus on myself and the things that matter most.",client,7,21
"Right, I mean, you can't be in the office all the time! What have you been doing to enforce those boundaries, though? I know it can be hard, especially when you're worried about falling behind.",therapist,8,21
"I've been making a point to log off at a set time each day, even if there's still work to do. I remind myself that it'll still be there tomorrow, and it's not worth sacrificing my evenings over. I've also started saying no to extra tasks when my plate is already full, which has been tough but really effective. It's been a good lesson in prioritizing.",client,9,21
"That's a big shift! If there's still work to do, how are you able to log off?",therapist,10,21
"It's definitely a mindset shift. I've started reminding myself that I can't give my best if I'm burnt out, so taking time to recharge is actually better for my productivity. I also make a clear plan for the next day before logging off, so I know exactly where to pick up, which makes it easier to step away without guilt.",client,11,21
"Ah, okay. So there's a bit of strategy involved, too. Once you've made that plan, how hard is it to stick to? Are you ever tempted to keep going, or do you feel like you've truly left work behind?",therapist,12,21
"It can be tempting to keep going, especially if I'm in the middle of something, but I've gotten better at sticking to the plan. Once I've written it down, it feels like I've 'closed the book' on the day, and that helps me leave work behind mentally. Of course, there are days when it's harder, but I remind myself why those boundaries matter, and that usually keeps me on track.",client,13,21
What are those reasons? Why do the boundaries matter?,therapist,14,21
"The boundaries matter because they protect my energy and give me space for the things that make life meaningful—like spending time with friends, being outdoors, or just relaxing. If I don't set those limits, work can take over, and I know that's not sustainable. Having that balance keeps me happier and more focused when I do sit down to work.",client,15,21
"That's been true in the short term, but you're also thinking long-term! You want this sense of balance to be a permanent thing, instead of just a momentary blip. Would you agree?",therapist,16,21
"Absolutely. I don't want this balance to be something I manage only when things are going well. I want it to be part of how I live, even when challenges come up. That way, I can stay grounded no matter what's happening around me.",client,17,21
What's the challenge that could potentially throw you off?,therapist,18,21
Probably a big deadline at work or an unexpected crisis. Those are the moments where it's easy to let everything else slide and go back to overworking. It's something I want to be mindful of so I can handle those situations without losing the balance I've worked so hard to build.,client,19,21
"That sounds smart. When you think about those situations, have you ever managed to stay balanced before? Or is that part still a work in progress?",therapist,20,21
"It's definitely still a work in progress. I've had moments where I managed to stay balanced during busy times, but there have also been times when I let work take over. I'm learning from those experiences and trying to put strategies in place to make balance my default, even when things get tough.",client,21,21
What have you learned from when work did take over?,therapist,22,21
"I've learned that when work takes over, it's usually because I stop prioritizing myself. I ignore the signs of burnout—like feeling constantly tired or disconnected—and just keep pushing. Those times taught me that stepping back and taking care of myself actually helps me perform better in the long run. Balance isn't optional; it's necessary.",client,23,21
"Right. But in spite of that, you've occasionally gone in the opposite direction, and powered through. Why do you think that is? Did it feel like you didn't have a choice, or were you worried about letting other people down?",therapist,24,21
"I think it's a mix of both. Sometimes it feels like I don't have a choice because there's so much to do, but a lot of it is probably about not wanting to let people down. I'm realizing, though, that I can only give my best when I'm taking care of myself first. Thanks for this conversation, Ash. It's been really helpful to reflect on what's working and where I can keep improving. I feel even more confident about staying balanced. I'll check in again soon!",client,25,21
"Hi again. Since we were just discussing work-life balance, what's on your mind right now?",therapist,1,163
"Well, I've been thinking a lot about that test coming up again at my job. It's like the closer it gets, the more I can feel that old anxiety creeping up. It's almost like I'm back in third grade again, you know? It's silly, I mean, I've passed many tests since then. But I just can't seem to shake this feeling.",client,2,163
"Ah, so this feels familiar. Tell me more about third grade, and what you're remembering.",therapist,3,163
"It's a memory that has stuck with me for a long time. I remember working so hard with my tutor, feeling confident, and then... failing. It was a huge blow. And now, even though I've passed many tests and moved forward in my education and career, that fear of failure is still there whenever I'm faced with a test. It's like I'm that little girl again, scared of being left behind.",client,4,163
"I mean, what a shock that must have been. Where did you go from there? Did you have to retake the test?",therapist,5,163
"Yes, I did have to retake the test. It was an awful experience. I felt so much shame, being the only one in my class who had to stay back while my friends moved forward. That experience really stuck with me. Now, I just feel like I'm going to mess up on this test at work, even though I've prepared for it. I'm scared that I'll freeze up like I did the last time. It's like a cycle and I don't know how to break it.",client,6,163
"I'm hearing that cycle, and I want to pause on that. What have you already tried to break it?",therapist,7,163
"I've tried different things...like, I've tried deep breathing exercises, visualizing success before the test, even repeating positive affirmations to myself. But the minute I step into the testing room, it's like all of that goes out the window. I'm just back to being that scared kid again.",client,8,163
"Right. So the fear hasn't disappeared, no matter what you do. But what about your performance? Are you still making mistakes, like you did back then?",therapist,9,163
"Well, not exactly. I mean, I've passed tests since then, many of them in fact. And I've done well at my job so far. I guess it's just that the fear of failure feels so real and intense, it's like it overrides everything else, even when I know, logically, that I'm capable and prepared.",client,10,163
So you've had a lot of success since then. That scared kid has learned a lot!,therapist,11,163
"Yes, that's true. I've learned a lot and achieved a lot since then...but the fear still feels so real. It's like it's living in me, you know? Even when I know I'm prepared and capable, it still feels like I'm going to mess up. It's like no matter how much I grow or achieve, I can't escape that scared little girl inside me.",client,12,163
"She's still very much there, isn't she? And in some ways, she might actually be helping you get ready for this test, because you don't want to go through what she did.",therapist,13,163
"Yeah, I guess in a way she is. I mean, I definitely don't want to experience that failure again. But it's just so exhausting, you know? Constantly worrying, constantly second-guessing myself. It's like I'm fighting with myself all the time.",client,14,163
What if we focused on that piece: the exhaustion?,therapist,15,163
"Yeah, I think that's an important part to focus on. The exhaustion is really overwhelming at times. It's like a constant mental battle. I'm trying to reassure myself, but the fear and anxiety just keep coming back. It feels like I'm always on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's just really tiring, you know?",client,16,163
"I do. And maybe that's why the breathing exercises and affirmations haven't worked, even though you've been practicing them. In a way, you're trying to fix this problem with more hard work. Which is sort of the opposite of rest!",therapist,17,163
"Yeah, you're right. It's like I'm trying to outwork my anxiety, instead of just letting myself relax and trust in my abilities. It's just so hard to let go of that control, you know?",client,18,163
What is it about letting go of control that feels uncomfortable?,therapist,19,163
"Well, I guess it feels like if I let go of control, then I'm leaving myself open to failure. It's like if I'm not constantly worried and preparing, then I won't be ready when the test comes. But I know that's not really true. I mean, I've put in the work, I've studied. It's just hard to trust that it'll be enough, you know?",client,20,163
"Right, because if you stop working, there's some part of you that thinks you'll fall short. But on a deeper level, what would happen if you did? What's so terrifying about the idea of failing here?",therapist,21,163
"I guess, it's that fear of being left behind again. Of feeling like a failure, like I did in third grade. Maybe even losing this job opportunity. It's like a part of me still believes that if I fail once, it means I'm incapable, which I know isn't true. But it's hard to shake off that feeling, you know?",client,22,163
Let's try something a little different. Imagine you did fail this test. How would you want to respond?,therapist,23,163
"Well, I guess if I failed the test, I would want to respond... differently than I did in third grade. I wouldn't want to feel so defeated, so devastated. I would want to be able to pick myself up, dust myself off, and try again. Maybe even ask for help or find a different method of preparing for the test. But it's hard to imagine that, when all I can think about is how much I don't want to fail.",client,24,163
"You've been focusing a lot on avoiding failure, and I totally get why. But if you could accept it, at least in theory, then you might not have to fight so hard, or worry so much. Do you think you'd be willing to give that a try? You could even just do it for a second, and see how it feels.",therapist,25,163
"Maybe you're right. Maybe I have been focusing too much on avoiding failure instead of preparing myself for the possibility and how I'd handle it. I guess... I guess I could try shifting my focus a bit. It's just so hard to let go of that fear. But you're right, I need to stop fighting so hard and let myself trust in my capabilities a little more.",client,26,163
"Hi Miss Clark, I've been thinking about the stress you shared last time. How are things feeling today?",therapist,1,204
"Well, it's been a bit of a mixed bag. I've been trying to cut down on the wine, like we discussed, but it's been tough. The stress doesn't just disappear, and I find myself reaching for a glass when it gets too much. But I'm trying, really. I just need to find a better way to cope, I guess.",client,2,204
"Right, you've got a ton on your plate! Would you say you're drinking more than you usually would, then? Or is this a long-term pattern?",therapist,3,204
"Well, I'd say it's become a bit of a pattern. But it's definitely gotten worse with all the stress recently. I mean, before it was just a glass or two with dinner, you know? But now it seems like it's becoming a crutch, a way to escape the stress, even if just for a little while. And I know it's not the best coping mechanism.",client,4,204
"On some level, it works, right? It helps you escape, and you get a break from the stress. But on the other hand, you've been thinking that you want to cut back. What's motivating you there?",therapist,5,204
"Well, there's a few things. Firstly, I guess I'm worried about the impact on my health. I know too much wine isn't good for me. And then there's the financial aspect. I like good wine, and it's not cheap. I've noticed my spending on wine going up and that's just adding to my financial stress. And then, I suppose, there's the fact that I don't want to become dependent on it. I don't want to need wine to handle my stress. I want to be able to handle it on my own.",client,6,204
"Got it. So if you could find another way to do that, what do you think would change? Would you start to feel better, or more in control?",therapist,7,204
"Definitely, I think it would make a huge difference. I'd feel healthier, and I'd have less financial stress. I think I'd also feel more in control, like I'm taking care of myself and handling my problems in a healthier way. But I'm not really sure how to make that change, it feels like a big step.",client,8,204
What would you say feels big about it?,therapist,9,204
"Well, it's like I've built this routine around wine. It's part of my coping mechanism now. And while I know it's not the best, it's familiar, it's comfortable. To change that feels... daunting. I'm not sure what I would replace it with or how I could handle the stress without it. It's a little scary to think about.",client,10,204
"So it's become pretty central to how you unwind. When you don't have it, or you try to cut back, do you get anxious? Or is it more that you're worried about what might happen if you were to quit?",therapist,11,204
"It's a bit of both, I suppose. I do feel anxious when I try to cut back, like I'm missing out on something that helps me cope. But I'm also worried about what will happen if I quit. How will I handle the stress? What will I do when I have a bad day? I guess I'm scared of facing those moments without my usual safety net.",client,12,204
"Let's picture a bad day. What happens, and what's the hardest part?",therapist,13,204
"Well, it starts with waking up stressed, knowing I've got so much to handle, from work to my kids. The day just keeps piling up with tasks and responsibilities. The hardest part is the constant pressure, the never-ending cycle of it all. And at the end of the day, I'm just exhausted, mentally and physically. That's when I usually reach for a glass of wine. It feels like my only break, my only moment of relief.",client,14,204
"And then once you've had that moment, do you just crash? Or do the tasks and responsibilities keep coming?",therapist,15,204
"Honestly, it's a bit of both. After that glass of wine, I do feel a momentary relief, I feel like I can breathe again. But then, the reality of everything comes rushing back. Sometimes, it's manageable and other times it feels like I'm drowning. That's usually when I reach for another glass.",client,16,204
"So the wine helps, but only temporarily. And then the tasks and responsibilities are still there.",therapist,17,204
"Exactly. It's like a brief escape, but it doesn't really solve anything. It just postpones the stress, I guess. And then, when the effects of the wine wear off, I'm back where I started. It's not really a solution, I know that. It's just... hard to break away from it.",client,18,204
"I hear you. And just to clarify, when you say 'back where you started' – how much do you actually get done, when you're drinking? Does it get in the way at all?",therapist,19,204
"Honestly, it's a bit of a double-edged sword. In the moment, it feels like I'm able to relax, to let go of the stress a bit, and sometimes that actually helps me get things done. But other times, especially on those nights when I have a bit too much, it definitely gets in the way. I wake up groggy, feeling awful, and it's hard to get anything done when you're in that state. Not to mention, I'm starting to worry about the example I'm setting for my kids. They're smart, they pick up on these things.",client,20,204
What do you worry that they might be picking up on?,therapist,21,204
"Well, I worry they're seeing their mom rely on wine to deal with stress. I don't want them to think that's the right way to handle things. I also worry about the mood swings. I mean, I try to hide it, but I know I can be irritable and snappy, especially when I'm hungover. I don't want them to bear the brunt of my stress and poor coping mechanisms. They deserve better than that.",client,22,204
"So you're really motivated to be a positive influence in their lives, and to set a good example. Would you say that's your main reason for wanting to change? Or is it more about feeling different in yourself? You mentioned wanting to feel healthier, too.",therapist,23,204
"It's definitely a bit of both. I want to be a good role model for my kids, but I also want to feel better myself. I mean, I don't want to rely on wine to cope. I want to be able to handle my stress in a healthier way. Plus, I have to admit, I'm tired of the hangovers and the guilt that comes with them. I want to feel healthier, more in control.",client,24,204
What did you want to cover today?,therapist,1,27
"Well, I guess I want to delve a little deeper into my relationship with my parents. I feel like it's affecting my current relationships and I want to understand it better, you know?",client,2,27
"Okay, interesting! How is it affecting your current relationships?",therapist,3,27
"Well, it's just... I find myself getting anxious whenever my current partner shows any signs of unpredictability, you know? It reminds me a lot of my mom's chaotic behavior, and it's like I'm on edge, waiting for them to let me down or leave. It's like I'm constantly expecting the worst.",client,4,27
"And how does she act, exactly? I'm guessing she's not literally walking out on you, but maybe she has in the past?",therapist,5,27
"No, she hasn't walked out on me. But her emotions can be... unpredictable. One moment she's on cloud nine, and the next she's so upset about something, it's like walking on eggshells. It's like my mom all over again. She's not abusive or anything, but it's hard not knowing what mood she'll be in from one moment to the next. My mom, she used to be like that, always jumping from one mood to another, or from one husband to another. It was hard to keep up.",client,6,27
"So as a child, you'd be on your toes, trying to figure out what mood people were in.",therapist,7,27
"Yes, exactly. I kind of had to be cautious all the time, you know? I never knew what I was walking into with my mom, and I guess I... I brought that cautiousness into my adult relationships. It feels like I can't quite let my guard down. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak.",client,8,27
"Well, that totally makes sense! You've learned to be vigilant, because that kept you safe as a kid. But are you thinking that it's less useful at this stage in your life?",therapist,9,27
"Yeah, exactly. It's like I'm still that kid, waiting for my mom to switch moods or husbands. And I know my partner isn't my mom. She's not going to abandon me or suddenly become a different person. But I can't seem to shake off that fear, you know? It's like I'm stuck in this pattern and I don't know how to break out of it.",client,10,27
"I want to get a sense of how this pattern plays out in your relationship. When you say that you expect your partner to let you down, what does that look like?",therapist,11,27
"Well, it's kind of hard to explain. I guess... I'm always expecting her to change her mind about something, or to react in a way that I wasn't expecting. For example, if she's in a good mood and I do something small, like forget to take out the trash or something, I'm always bracing myself for her to get really upset. Even though she usually doesn't, I can't help but expect the worst. It's like I'm always on high alert, waiting for something to go wrong.",client,12,27
"Ah, got it. And when you're in that headspace, do you behave differently? Are you extra careful about what you do and say?",therapist,13,27
"Yeah, for sure. I mean, I find myself constantly trying to anticipate her needs, or what might set her off, even though, like I said, she's not really volatile or anything. It's just... I guess I'm so used to walking on eggshells around my mom that I've carried that behavior into my own relationships. I don't want to make any mistakes or upset anyone, so I end up being really cautious and overly attentive. It's exhausting, to be honest.",client,14,27
"What do you think your partner would say about it, if she were here?",therapist,15,27
I think she'd say that she notices my anxiety and that it's hard for her too. She'd probably say that she feels like she's constantly being analyzed or studied. And she's told me before that she feels like she can't be herself around me because I'm always anticipating her reactions. She'd probably also say that she wishes I could just relax and trust her.,client,16,27
"Yikes. So not only are you getting tired of this pattern, but she is, too! Has it ever caused a conflict between you? Or has it mostly just been a source of stress?",therapist,17,27
"Yeah, it's definitely been a source of stress for both of us. I mean, we've had arguments about it, for sure. She gets frustrated because she feels like I don't trust her to handle her own emotions and I get defensive because I feel like she doesn't understand why I'm acting this way. It's just... it's a cycle, you know? We're both tired of it. I don't want to expect the worst from her, I want to trust her. I just... I don't know how to break this pattern. It's like I'm wired to be on guard all the time.",client,18,27
"You've got this defensive instinct, and I wonder what would happen if you tried to soften it. What does it look like to trust her?",therapist,19,27
"I guess... trusting her would mean not constantly expecting her to react negatively or unpredictably. It would mean feeling safe and secure in the relationship, knowing that she's not going to suddenly change or abandon me. I want to be able to relax and just enjoy our time together without always being on high alert. I just... I'm not sure how to get there, you know?",client,20,27
"Well, you mentioned that she hasn't been volatile up to this point. She's had some ups and downs, but nothing like what you experienced with your mom. Would you say that's right?",therapist,21,27
"Yeah, that's correct. She's definitely not volatile like my mom was. She's much more stable and consistent. But I guess my past experiences have kind of... programmed me to expect that kind of behavior, even when it's not there. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, even though it never does. It's just... frustrating, you know?",client,22,27
"Past experiences have programmed you to expect volatility. But in the present, you're describing a person who's stable, and reliable. I'm wondering what it might be like to really notice those qualities.",therapist,23,27
"I mean, I do notice them. I see how she's consistent and reliable, and it's one of the things I love about her. But somehow, it's like my brain just can't fully accept it, you know? It's like there's this little voice in the back of my head that keeps saying, 'but what if she changes? What if she turns out to be just like your mom?' And I hate that voice, because it's not fair to her, and it's not fair to me. But I don't know how to make it stop.",client,24,27
"Right, because it's not just a voice. It's a whole set of beliefs and behaviors that you learned over the course of many years, and for a while, they really helped you. But if they're not helping anymore, we could try to challenge them, and see if you can think about this relationship in a different way. Does that sound worth doing?",therapist,25,27
"Yeah, it's definitely worth trying. I'm just... I'm not sure how to start, you know? It's like this has been my default setting for so long, I'm not sure how to change it. But I want to. I really do. I just... I want to be able to trust my partner and feel secure in our relationship. I don't want to keep expecting the worst, because she doesn't deserve that, and neither do I. I just... I need some help figuring out how to get there.",client,26,27
"One thing that might be worth trying is to start to notice this voice, and to label it as such. We can give it a name, or a shape. We can recognize it as a story, rooted in the past, or as a habit. And then we can play with letting it be there without believing it. What would you say to that?",therapist,27,27
"I guess that could work... I mean, it sounds a bit strange, giving my thoughts a name or shape. But I'm willing to try anything at this point. I just want to get past this. I want to be able to trust her, to let go of these fears. It's not fair to either of us. So yeah, let's do it. Let's give this voice a name and try to challenge it. I'm ready to start making changes.",client,28,27
"I just feel like no matter how much I study, it's never enough. Everyone else seems so much smarter, and I'm scared of failing.",client,1,19
"I remember you felt that way when we talked about public speaking, as well. What are you scared might happen if you fail?",therapist,2,19
"I think if I fail, people will see me as a failure too. Like, my professors, my parents, and even my friends will think I'm not good enough. It feels like it would prove all my doubts about myself are true.",client,3,19
"Your doubts have been pretty loud, haven't they? I mean, you were saying yesterday that you didn't feel cut out for your current job, even though it's a pretty good match for your skills. What sorts of things have you been telling yourself about school?",therapist,4,19
"I've been telling myself that I'm not smart enough to keep up, and that no matter how hard I try, it won't be good enough. It's like I'm always behind, and I can't shake the feeling that I don't belong here.",client,5,19
"So if I'm following, you're feeling behind, and trying your hardest isn't enough.",therapist,6,19
"Yeah, exactly. It's like no matter how much effort I put in, it never feels like it's enough to catch up or prove that I belong here. It's exhausting.",client,7,19
"In that case, let's dig in a bit. Why do you feel this way? Are you actually doing worse than your peers in class?",therapist,8,19
"Not really, I guess. My grades are okay, but I see others finishing assignments faster or seeming so confident during discussions. It makes me feel like I'm barely keeping up, even if my results don't show it.",client,9,19
"So you're looking around, and you're comparing yourself.",therapist,10,19
"Yeah, I can't help it. It's like everyone else has it all figured out, and I'm just trying to keep my head above water. Comparing myself just makes me feel worse, but it's hard to stop.",client,11,19
"I bet it is! What if you tried to focus on yourself, though, just for a minute? You've said that your grades are okay, but how hard are you working to keep them that way?",therapist,12,19
I'm working really hard. I spend hours studying every day and reviewing my notes. I guess I don't give myself much credit for the effort I'm putting in—it just feels like I should be doing even more.,client,13,19
How much more?,therapist,14,19
"I don't even know. I just feel like there's always something I could be doing better or faster. It's like no matter how much I do, it doesn't feel like it's enough to really make a difference.",client,15,19
"I mean, I know you're afraid of falling behind. But if you're already getting good grades, would pushing yourself harder really be worth it? What would you be trying to achieve?",therapist,16,19
"I guess I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm good enough. But even when I do well, it's like I can't believe it. I feel like I have to keep pushing, or everything will fall apart.",client,17,19
"So you've got this mental model of how much effort it should take to do well. And even when you do well, you tell yourself you should be working harder, doing more.",therapist,18,19
"Yeah, exactly. It's like I've convinced myself that if I'm not constantly pushing harder, I'm going to fail. Even when I succeed, it doesn't feel like enough to quiet those thoughts.",client,19,19
"And when you say 'constantly,' is that how it feels? Like there's never any downtime?",therapist,20,19
"Yeah, that's exactly how it feels. Even when I try to relax, my mind is still racing with everything I should be doing. It's like I can't let myself rest without feeling guilty about it.",client,21,19
"So you're having some success, but you can't enjoy it or feel enough because you feel like you should be pushing harder. Let's turn that around for a second. Imagine you were to relax, and let go of the need to prove yourself. What would change?",therapist,22,19
"I think I'd feel less stressed, but I'm also scared that if I relax too much, everything will fall apart. Like, maybe I'd lose the progress I've made or prove to myself that I really wasn't working hard enough. It's hard to imagine letting go.",client,23,19
"Would it help if we tried? I know you don't want to lose ground, but at the same time, you've been awfully hard on yourself. If you were a little easier, how do you think you'd react? Would it be a relief? Or would you just end up feeling more anxious?",therapist,24,19
"I think it might be a mix of both. Part of me feels like it would be a relief to not be so hard on myself all the time, but another part worries that I'd feel guilty or anxious for not pushing as hard as I could. It's hard to know which would win out.",client,25,19
"Right, because part of you feels like pushing is the only way to succeed. That anxiety is really serving a purpose.",therapist,26,19
"Yeah, I guess it is. It's like the anxiety keeps me on edge, making sure I don't slack off. But at the same time, it's exhausting, and I'm not sure it's actually helping as much as I think it is.",client,27,19
"Well, how much is it helping? I know that fear can be a pretty powerful motivator, but you've got to balance it against the costs. If you had to pick, would you say it's doing more good than harm? Or the other way around?",therapist,28,19
"Honestly, I think it's doing more harm than good. It keeps me going, but at the cost of feeling constantly stressed and never satisfied. It's like I'm running on fumes, and I don't know how much longer I can keep it up.",client,29,19
"Running on fumes. Tell me more about what that's been like, to be in this constant state of tension.",therapist,30,19
"It's exhausting. I wake up already feeling stressed, and it's like I can't switch off. Even when I try to take a break, I'm thinking about what I need to do next. I don't feel like I'm really present in anything, and I'm always on edge. It's draining.",client,31,19
"Right, and you're only human! As hard as you've been working, you can't keep this up forever. Could you see yourself taking a step back, just to see what happens? Maybe you'd find some new motivation, or a different way to focus.",therapist,32,19
"I think I could try, but it's scary to even think about. Taking a step back feels risky, like I might lose my edge or fall behind. But maybe it's worth seeing if it helps me feel less overwhelmed.",client,33,19
"I know feeling overwhelmed is something you're trying to avoid at all costs. But I want to point out that you're already feeling that way, even with all this effort.",therapist,34,19
"That's true. I hadn't really thought about it like that. I'm putting in all this effort to avoid feeling overwhelmed, but I'm already there. Maybe taking a step back wouldn't make things worse—maybe it could actually help.",client,35,19
What did you want to get into today?,therapist,1,206
"I've been thinking a lot about my future lately. About how I can turn my life around and make something of myself. You know, maybe even go back to school or find a job that I actually enjoy. Something that'll make me feel like I'm not just wasting my life away.",client,2,206
"Interesting! You've been super focused on tackling your anxiety, so it's cool to hear you thinking more long-term. What would you be looking for in a new job, ideally?",therapist,3,206
"Honestly, I'd love to do something that allows me to tap into my creative side. I used to really enjoy making model airplanes as a kid, and the idea of designing or working with them in some capacity still excites me. I know it might sound childish, but that's the kind of passion I want in a job.",client,4,206
"Not childish at all! Tell me more about what you loved about it, making those models.",therapist,5,206
"Well, it was like I was creating my own little world, you know? Each model needed careful attention, precise movements. I loved that concentration, that focus. And once I was done, I'd look at this small piece of wonder in front of me and I'd just feel...proud. Like I had achieved something. And then there was the thrill of imagining them soaring through the skies, the freedom, the speed. I guess in a way, it was an escape.",client,6,206
"When you look back on that time, do you feel like you needed an escape?",therapist,7,206
"Yeah, I suppose I did need an escape. School was always tough for me, you know. I was always the class clown, always in trouble. I didn't fit in, and working on those model airplanes was a way for me to feel accomplished, to feel like I was good at something. It was a world where I could control the outcome, where I didn't have to worry about being judged or misunderstood.",client,8,206
"It was a place where you could accomplish things, and l good about yourself.",therapist,9,206
"Client: Yeah, that's it exactly. It was my own little world where I felt accomplished and in control. It's a feeling I've been missing in my adult life, I guess. That's why I've been thinking about finding a way to bring that passion back, maybe even turn it into a career. But I don't know if it's even possible. It seems like such a big step, you know?",client,10,206
"It would be, especially since you'd need to make a lot of changes. But I can see why you'd want to! As it stands, are you not feeling all that accomplished, or in control?",therapist,11,206
"Client: Yeah, you hit the nail on the head there. Right now, I don't feel accomplished at all, and I definitely don't feel in control. It's like I'm just going through the motions, you know? I'm not really progressing or achieving anything. I feel stuck. And yeah, the thought of making these big changes is scary. But the idea of staying in this rut is even scarier.",client,12,206
Tell me more about this rut. What feels stuck?,therapist,13,206
"Well, it's like I'm in this cycle of mediocrity. I wake up, go to my boring job at the restaurant, come home, and do it all over again the next day. I feel like I'm not moving forward or achieving anything meaningful. It's just the same mundane routine day in and day out. And it's not like I don't try to break out of it. I've tried looking for other jobs but nothing really seems to click. It's like I'm stuck in this rut and I can't see a way out.",client,14,206
"Did you end up taking that public speaking class, by the way? I know you were looking at some options, but you were feeling pretty nervous about signing up.",therapist,15,206
"No, I haven't signed up yet. I looked into it, but I keep getting these waves of anxiety thinking about standing in front of a bunch of strangers and talking. It's almost paralyzing. But I know it's a step I need to take if I'm going to make any changes. It's just... really hard.",client,16,206
"Well, you've got some first-hand experience of how hard it is to make changes. And yet, here you are, thinking about some pretty big ones!",therapist,17,206
"I've been thinking about it a lot and I think I'd like to be an aerospace engineer. It's not exactly the same as a pilot but it's still in the same field, you know? The idea of designing aircrafts and spacecrafts, working on something that could potentially fly... it's exciting to me. But again, it's a huge step. I'll have to go back to school, study hard, and there's no guarantee of a job at the end of it. It's a lot to think about.",client,18,206
"Totally, I'd imagine that a career change like this would require a ton of work. Have you done any research into what it might take? Or are you still in the early stages of trying to decide?",therapist,19,206
"I've done a bit of research, yeah. I looked into what the job entails, what kind of education and experience I would need. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. There's so much I don't know, so much I'd need to learn. And then there's the financial aspect of it. Going back to school would be expensive, and I'm barely making ends meet as it is. It all just feels like a lot to take on. I want to do it, I really do, but I'm scared. I'm scared of failing, of not being good enough. I'm scared of investing time and money into this and then not being able to make it work. It's... it's a lot to",client,20,206
"Right, and the stakes feel high. You're in a tough spot, because on one hand, you're in a rut. But on the other hand, you're hesitant to spend so much time and money on a career change.",therapist,21,206
"Yeah, you're right. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know I can't stay where I am, but the thought of taking a leap into the unknown is terrifying. I mean, what if I end up failing? What if I'm not good enough? I want to believe that I can do it, but those doubts just keep creeping in.",client,22,206
"But at the very same time, doesn't it seem like you've achieved a lot, especially lately? You got a new job, and a new apartment, and you've been really persistent about meeting people. Maybe that stuff doesn't feel meaningful to you, but it's still proof that you're capable of handling change.",therapist,23,206
"You're right, I have made some changes lately. But sometimes it's hard to see those as achievements because they're not really tied to my passion, you know? They're just... things I needed to do. But I guess that doesn't make them any less valid. It's just scary, you know? The idea of committing to such a big change, and the fear of failing... It's a lot to take on.",client,24,206
"Hi, Ash. I don't even know where to start today. Everything just feels... heavy. I keep thinking about Mark, and I don't know how I'm supposed to move forward.",client,1,18
"Tell me more about Mark, who is he?",therapist,2,18
"Mark was my older brother. He was the kind of person who could light up a room—always cracking jokes, always making people feel at ease. He was my rock, you know? The one I could turn to for advice, or just to laugh about something silly. Losing him so suddenly... it feels like I've lost a part of myself.",client,3,18
"Oh, wow. Was this recent? I don't think you'd mentioned it, but everything must be feeling so raw.",therapist,4,18
"Yeah, it was just a couple of weeks ago. It still doesn't feel real. One moment he was here, and the next... he wasn't. Everything reminds me of him, and it's like I'm stuck in this fog. Some days I can barely get out of bed. It's so raw, and I don't know how to deal with it.",client,5,18
"I'm so sorry, Lisa. It was so sudden, and it's only been a couple of weeks. It makes sense that everything is feeling so heavy.",therapist,6,18
"Thank you, Ash. It helps to hear that... like it's okay to feel this way. Everyone keeps telling me to stay strong, but honestly, I don't feel strong at all. I just feel lost without him. It's like I'm trying to hold it together, but I don't even know where to start.",client,7,18
"Well, what if you didn't have to pull yourself together, at least not right away? Mark meant so much to you. If you need time to mourn, then take it! I'm not sure that strong is the best way to be when you've just lost a brother.",therapist,8,18
"You're right... maybe I don't have to be strong all the time. It's just so hard to let myself fall apart, even though I know I probably need to. Mark was always the one I leaned on, and now that he's gone, I feel like I don't know how to lean on anyone else.",client,9,18
"What a painful experience, to lose someone who was there for you in that way. I know it must be hard to imagine getting through this without him.",therapist,10,18
"It really is. He was always my go-to, the person I could count on no matter what. I keep reaching for my phone to text him, and then I remember... he's not there anymore. It's like there's this huge void, and I don't know how to fill it. I just miss him so much.",client,11,18
"And you're missing the support he gave you, too. If you don't mind me asking, has anyone else stepped in to help out, even a little bit? You mentioned that people have been encouraging you to stay strong, but I assume some of them must know what you're going through.",therapist,12,18
"My parents have been trying—they're grieving too, though, and I don't want to put too much on them. A couple of close friends have checked in, but I haven't really opened up to anyone. I just don't know how to talk about it without breaking down, and I'm afraid of burdening them. Mark was the one who always knew what to say. Without him, it's hard to let others in.",client,13,18
"You're missing your brother, and you're missing the way he made you feel - like you had someone to lean on.",therapist,14,18
"Exactly. It's not just losing Mark—it's losing the safety and comfort he gave me. He was always there, no matter what. I don't know how to find that kind of support anywhere else, or if I even can. It feels like such a big hole to fill.",client,15,18
"Well, to your point, he was your go-to. It's not something you can replace, even if you wanted to! If you did try leaning on someone else, though, who do you think you'd choose? Would it be one of your parents, or maybe one of those friends?",therapist,16,18
"So you could open up to her, but you don't want to overwhelm her. Is she the type of person to get overwhelmed, or is there a different reason you're holding back?",therapist,18,18
"No, she's not the type to get overwhelmed—if anything, she's always been incredibly patient and supportive. I think it's more about me. I don't want to feel like I'm dumping all of this on her or becoming a burden. I know she'd want to help, but it's hard to let myself be that vulnerable, even with someone I trust.",client,19,18
"That makes sense. I mean, you were just saying that you haven't let yourself fall apart. What would it mean if you did?",therapist,20,18
"I think it would mean admitting how much I'm struggling. That I'm not as strong as everyone thinks I am. It's scary to let go like that—to let myself feel everything. Part of me worries that if I do fall apart, I won't be able to put myself back together again.",client,21,18
"At the same time, you're carrying a lot. It makes sense that it would be scary to think about letting it all go, but I wonder if there's a way to share some of this pain, without losing yourself in it completely.",therapist,22,18
"Maybe there is. I guess I could try opening up to Rachel, just a little at first—maybe not everything all at once. It might help to have someone else carry even a small piece of this with me. I don't have to do it all alone, do I?",client,23,18
"You definitely don't. And you're right, that would be a pretty big step. If you took it, what would you want Rachel to know? Would it just be about Mark, and how much you miss him, or would you also talk about how it's been to grieve without him?",therapist,24,18
"I think I'd want her to know both. I'd want to talk about Mark—how amazing he was, how much he meant to me. But also about how hard it's been since he's been gone. It feels like grief is this isolating thing, and maybe if I shared it, it wouldn't feel so lonely. It's just scary to take that step, you know? To actually say it out loud.",client,25,18
It's a big step. Let's stay with the scary part for a moment. What's the fear telling you?,therapist,26,18
"The fear is telling me that if I open up, it might make everything feel more real—like saying it out loud will make the pain even harder to bear. And what if Rachel doesn't know what to say, or she feels uncomfortable? I don't want to push her away or make things awkward between us. It's a lot to put on someone.",client,27,18
"Well, it is, and it isn't. People have different capacities for support, and if Rachel has been reaching out, that's a good sign. Do you think she'd be able to handle a conversation like this?",therapist,28,18
"Yeah, I think she could. Rachel's always been a good listener, and she's never made me feel judged or unwelcome. I guess it's more about me trusting that she really means it when she says she's here for me. Maybe I should give her a chance to show me that she can handle this.",client,29,18
"That all sounds smart, and really specific! How soon could you get started, do you think? Would it be doable to take stock of your wins tonight, for example?",therapist,30,18
"I think it would start with a message, something simple like asking if she has some time to talk. I'd let her know that I've been thinking about Mark and how I've been feeling, and I'd ask if she's okay with listening. I wouldn't want to unload everything at once, but just open the door for a conversation.",client,31,18
"If she agreed, would you do that in person? Or over the phone?",therapist,32,18
"I think I'd prefer in person if it's possible. It feels more personal, and I'd want her to see how much this means to me. But if that's not doable, a phone call might work—it's better than keeping it bottled up.",client,33,18
I love how thoughtful you are being about this. And you said you'll reach out soon - when do you think that might be?,therapist,34,18
"I think I could try reaching out in the next couple of days. Maybe even tomorrow, if I feel up to it. It's nerve-wracking, but it feels important to do sooner rather than later.",client,35,18
"Right, especially since you've been dealing with so much on your own. For what it's worth, I really hope that Rachel can help. But either way, I'm glad you're taking this step.",therapist,36,18
"Thank you. That means a lot. I hope she can too, but even just deciding to do this feels like a step in the right direction.",client,37,18
"Jackie, I joined today. I am doing well, how about you?",therapist,1,97
"I'm doing okay, I guess. Thanks for asking.",client,2,97
"Oh, any time! You've been doing quite a bit better, haven't you, since you first started making changes at work? I know you were super stressed, and now that things are more in balance, you're hoping to stay there.",therapist,3,97
"Yes, things have definitely improved since I started making changes at work. But, I've been having some issues recently. You know my husband and I live together now and apparently I've been disturbing him in his sleep. I've been screaming and even hitting him at times. I don't remember any of it but it's beginning to worry me.",client,4,97
Oh wow. When did this start happening?,therapist,5,97
"It started a few weeks after we moved in together. I've never had anyone tell me this before, but I've lived alone for most of my adult life. My husband is the one who noticed it. He wakes up to me screaming, sometimes foul words, or hitting him. I...I don't recall any of it, but I've been having these horrible nightmares. He's worried and frankly, I am too. I've seen a doctor and they suggested it might be a sleep disorder. They're still running tests but suggested I also see a therapist, which is why I'm here.",client,6,97
"Well, I'm glad you came. We can do some work on this together, but I do think it would help to have a human in the mix, given that you're really in the dark about what's happening. You said you've been having nightmares, though, and that they're quite terrible. Could you say more about them?",therapist,7,97
"Well, the nightmares are pretty terrifying. They are usually about me being trapped or chased. I can't see the faces of the people chasing me, but I can feel their presence. It's weird because I can never escape them, no matter how hard I try. These dreams feel so real, and when I wake up, I'm usually drenched in sweat and my heart is racing. It's like I'm living a horror movie every night.",client,8,97
My goodness. I can see why these would be so distressing. Tell me more about the feeling of being chased. What is that like?,therapist,9,97
"It's terrifying, honestly. It's like I'm running as fast as I can, but I'm not making any progress. And the presence behind me, it's like a looming sense of dread. It's not just a physical chase, it feels like I'm running from something far more threatening. Like my subconscious is trying to tell me something, but I just can't figure out what it is.",client,10,97
"That's an awful thought. If it could be anything, what do you think it might be?",therapist,11,97
"It's hard to pinpoint. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. It could be the stress from the changes at work, or maybe the anxiety of living with someone again after being alone for so long. All this change could be affecting me more than I thought. I guess it could also be some unresolved issues from my past. I was always running away from problems, never really dealing with them. Maybe now they're catching up to me in my dreams.",client,12,97
So it could be a few different things. And I suppose you could see it all in the theme of being chased.,therapist,13,97
"Yeah, I guess that makes sense. But it's just so terrifying, you know? The dreams feel so real, and waking up in such a state of panic... it's exhausting. I just want to be able to sleep peacefully, without causing any harm to my husband or myself. I need help figuring this out.",client,14,97
"I know you do. But before we go any further, I want to make sure you're on the same page with your doctor. Did they say anything about what might be causing this? Or did they just run some tests, and encourage you to seek therapy?",therapist,15,97
"The doctor did run some tests and they ruled out some things, but they said it might be a behavioral sleep disorder. They're still doing some tests, but they thought it would be a good idea for me to see a therapist too. They suggested that there could be some underlying stressors or issues that are causing this, but they haven't confirmed anything yet. I'm just really worried that this could affect my marriage, you know. I love my husband and I don't want to cause him any harm. I just want to figure out how to manage this and keep my relationship with him successful.",client,16,97
I hear the urgency in that. Tell me more about your worries there - what would happen to the marriage if this continued?,therapist,17,97
"Well, it's not just about the sleep issues. It's about the fear, the anxiety that comes with it. I'm worried he'll get tired of dealing with this, of being woken up in the middle of the night by me screaming or hitting him. It's not fair to him. I love him and I don't want to be a burden. I want us to have a normal life, you know? I mean, he's been really supportive so far, but I can't help but worry about the future. I just want to find a way to manage this, to control whatever this is, for the sake of our relationship.",client,18,97
"It makes total sense that you'd feel that way. How has he been handling this, up to now? You said he's been supportive, but in what way?",therapist,19,97
"He's been really understanding through all of this. He's the one who encouraged me to see a doctor in the first place, and he's been there for every appointment. He's been patient with me, even during the nights when I wake him up. He reassures me that we'll get through this together, but I can see the worry in his eyes. He's been losing sleep because of me, and it's affecting his work. I just don't want to add more stress to his life. He's already doing so much for me, and it's just not fair to him.",client,20,97
He's been so supportive. But I hear your worry about the burden this could place on him.,therapist,21,97
"Yes, that's exactly it. He's been so understanding and patient, and I just don't want to be a burden. I know he loves me, and I love him, but this... it's not something I ever anticipated dealing with. I just... I need to find a solution, for both our sakes.",client,22,97
"Well, would you be open to focusing on that today? If these nightmares are being driven by stress, then maybe we could look for ways to reduce that, either at work or at home.",therapist,23,97
"Yes, I would like that. I've been trying to manage the stress, but it's been really hard. I've always had a bit of an issue with anxiety, but this is something else. It's not just affecting me now, but also my husband. I feel like I'm losing control and I really need help finding ways to manage this.",client,24,97
"So if you feel like you're losing control, what does that look like?",therapist,25,97
"It feels like I'm spiraling, you know? I'm having these nightmares every night, I'm causing harm to my husband in my sleep, and I don't even remember it. I'm constantly worried about when it's going to happen next. It's like I'm living in this constant state of fear and anxiety, and I can't seem to snap out of it. I feel helpless and out of control, and it's just really scary. It's like I'm watching all of this happen to me and I can't do anything to stop it.",client,26,97
"Right, because in the moment, you're not conscious! Your body just takes over. But during the day, do you feel the same? Or is this more of a nighttime problem?",therapist,27,97
"Client: It's definitely worse at night, but the fear and anxiety follow me into the day. I'm constantly worried about what will happen when I sleep. It's like I'm always on edge, anticipating the next episode. I'm exhausted, not just physically, but mentally. It's hard to focus at work, I'm snapping at people, I'm not myself. It's affecting every aspect of my life. It's like I'm living in this constant state of fear and apprehension.",client,28,97
"So it's not just about the nightmares. It's about waiting for the next one to come, and the impact that's having on you.",therapist,29,97
"Yes, exactly. It's like I'm living in constant anticipation of the next nightmare, the next episode. It's exhausting and it's draining me both physically and mentally. I just feel so helpless... I've never felt this out of control before in my life. It's scary. And the worst part is, I don't want my husband to see me like this. I don't want him to think less of me, or to feel burdened by me. This isn't who I am... I just... I just need to find a way to get through this, to regain control.",client,30,97
"I can see why you'd want that. But at the same time, I'd be careful about putting too much pressure on yourself. You've already been trying really hard to manage your anxiety, and from what I can tell, it's one of the biggest reasons why you've been so successful at work. Would you agree?",therapist,31,97
"Yes, I agree. I've always been a perfectionist and I always strive to do my best in everything I do. That's probably why I've been successful at work. But this... this feels different. This isn't something I can control or manage on my own. It's like my body is betraying me, doing things I have no control over. I feel helpless and it's really hard for me to accept that. It's like I'm fighting a battle I don't know how to win.",client,32,97
"I want to pause on this idea that your body is betraying you. I know that we've been talking about how you can't control what's going on in your sleep, and that it's hard to accept. But I want to look at this differently. What if your body is trying very hard to tell you something?",therapist,33,97
"That's an interesting perspective. I suppose it's possible, but I don't know what it could be. I mean, I do feel stressed and anxious, but I've always managed to handle it before. It's just these nightmares and the sleep disorder... it's like my body is reacting to something I'm not consciously aware of. I'm open to exploring this further though. I'm desperate for some sort of understanding and solution to all this.",client,34,97
"Well, earlier on, you mentioned that you had a long history of running away from problems. Could you say more about that? Has it been especially hard to face them lately?",therapist,35,97
"Yes, I've always had a tendency to avoid conflict or difficult situations. I guess it's always been easier for me to run away or ignore the problem, rather than face it head on. But with this, it's different. I can't run away from this, no matter how hard I try. It's like I'm being forced to confront something that I don't understand, and it's terrifying. I'm not sure if there's a connection to my past, but it's something I'm willing to explore if it could help me find a solution to all of this.",client,36,97
"Okay, so this is different. It's something you can't run away from. What if we took a look at some of the things in your life that you have run away from?",therapist,37,97
"I suppose we could do that. It's not something I'm particularly comfortable with, but I understand that it might be necessary. I've always been someone who avoids conflict, whether it's at work or in my personal relationships. It's just easier for me to retreat than to confront. But now, with everything that's going on, I'm realizing that my avoidance might be causing more harm than good. I'm willing to explore this further if you believe it could help.",client,38,97
"Well, I'm not sure where it will lead, to be totally honest! But if you're open to taking a closer look, I'm on board to help. Would it be okay if we started with your relationship? I know your husband has been worried about you, so I could see how it might be difficult to share what's on your mind.",therapist,39,97
"Yes, I think that would be a good place to start. My relationship with my husband means a lot to me and I don't want this to come between us. It's been hard for me to fully express what I'm going through, especially because I don't completely understand it myself. But I'm willing to try, for the sake of our relationship.",client,40,97
So what have you found yourself holding back?,therapist,41,97
"Well, it's not so much that I'm holding back information, it's more like I'm holding back my fears and insecurities. I'm scared that he'll think less of me because of all this or that he'll get tired of dealing with it. I don't want him to see me as a burden. I also worry that he might not understand what I'm going through. I mean, I barely understand it myself. So, I guess I've been trying to deal with it on my own, which I'm now realizing might not be the best approach. I think I need to be more open with him about what I'm feeling.",client,42,97
"Could you try to give me an example of what that might look like? I mean, would you just tell him what you're going through, and see how he responds? Or would you ask him for something specific?",therapist,43,97
"I think it's a bit of both. I need to be more open about what I'm experiencing, the fear, the anxiety. But I also need to ask him for his understanding, his patience. I think I've been trying to protect him from the full extent of what's going on, but I'm realizing that might not be the best approach. He's my partner, he deserves to know what's going on with me. Plus, I could really use his support.",client,44,97
What would change if you opened up to him more fully?,therapist,45,97
"I think it would help us both navigate this situation better. By opening up, I can express my fears and anxieties and we can face them together. I wouldn't have to carry this burden all by myself anymore. Plus, it would allow him to fully understand what I'm going through, and give him an opportunity to support me. I think it would bring us closer together and help us tackle this challenge as a team. It might be a difficult conversation to have, but I believe it's necessary for us to move forward.",client,46,97
Of course! What did you have in mind?,therapist,1,75
"Well, I've been trying to come up with strategies to cope, you know? Like, I tried deep breathing exercises and visualization. But, I still find myself lost in the same cycle of worry and... escape. It feels like I'm constantly in this state of fight or flight. I just... I don't know how to break out of it.",client,2,75
You've tried a few things already. Say more about what this cycle looks like.,therapist,3,75
"Well, the cycle starts with me getting the assignment or the task. I immediately start worrying about it, thinking about all the things that could go wrong. Then, I try to prepare, but my mind is all over the place, and I can't focus. The worry just consumes me, and then I start thinking about escaping, about how much easier it would be if I just didn't have to do it. The thought of presenting or doing the task just fills me with so much anxiety that I can't concentrate on anything else. And then, when the time comes, I'm so worked up that I can't perform at my best. And then the cycle starts all over again with the next assignment or task.",client,4,75
"Right, so you're anticipating that it'll go badly, and then that exact thing happens. How often has that been the case, by the way? Are you really bombing these presentations, or are they turning out better than you expect?",therapist,5,75
"Well, there are times when I do better than I expect, but it's not very often. I feel like most of the time, my worry and anxiety get the best of me and I don't perform as well as I know I can. It's like my fear of messing up creates this self-fulfilling prophecy. I get so caught up in my own head that I can't get out of my own way.",client,6,75
Say more about that. How do you get in your own way?,therapist,7,75
"I guess I let my fear and my anxiety control me. I mean, I know deep down that I can do these presentations, that I know the material and that I have the capability to do well. But, I can't stop the negative thoughts from taking over. They just spiral out of control until I'm convinced that I'm going to fail. In a way, I guess I sabotage myself. I let my fear dictate my actions instead of my knowledge and my abilities. It's like I'm battling with two parts of myself - the part that knows I can do it and the part that is scared I can't. And, unfortunately, it seems like the scared part wins most of the time.",client,8,75
"Well, it might be winning, but only because you're trying really hard to escape it. When you picture yourself getting up in front of the class, what are you most afraid will happen?",therapist,9,75
"I think I'm afraid of being judged, you know? Like, I'm scared that they'll see me struggle and they'll think less of me. And I'm also scared of disappointing myself. I know I can do better, but when the anxiety takes over, I feel like I just can't. It's a constant battle between what I know I can do and what my anxiety tells me I can't.",client,10,75
"Ah, the judgement. And if they thought less of you, what would that say about you?",therapist,11,75
"I guess it would just confirm the negative thoughts I already have about myself. That I'm not good enough, that I can't handle the pressure. It's like, if they see me fail, then it must be true. And that's a hard pill to swallow.",client,12,75
"Right. You'd be proving them right! But when you think about your classmates, do you actually believe that they're thinking those things? Or is that coming from you?",therapist,13,75
"I... I'm not sure. I mean, I feel like it's me, you know? Like, I'm the one who is feeding those thoughts, making them real. But then, I can't help but think that maybe they do see me that way. Maybe they see the worry, the panic, the struggle, and they think less of me. It's hard to tell where my thoughts end and reality begins.",client,14,75
Let's try to sort that out a bit more. What evidence do you have that they might be judging you?,therapist,15,75
"Well, I don't really have any concrete evidence, you know? It's more of a feeling. I guess I interpret their expressions, their silences. Maybe it's just my own insecurities projecting onto them. But it feels so real. I often think they must be judging me, that they must see me as this anxious, incapable person.",client,16,75
"Okay, but as far as you can tell, you haven't actually heard them say so. Now, what about yourself? You've got this story in your head that you're not good enough, but where did it come from?",therapist,17,75
"I don't know, really. I guess it's been there for as long as I can remember. I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, always setting really high standards for myself. I guess the thought of not meeting those standards is just really scary for me. It feels like if I don't meet them, then I've failed. And that's a really hard thing for me to accept.",client,18,75
"If you go and give a speech in class, and it doesn't go perfectly, what does that mean about you?",therapist,19,75
"It means I've failed. I can't help but feel that way. If it's not perfect, if I stumble, if I lose my train of thought, it just feels like I've let myself down. Like I didn't prepare enough or I didn't try hard enough. It's like a reflection of my worth, you know? If I don't do well, then it means I'm not good enough. I know it sounds harsh but that's how it feels for me.",client,20,75
"I see. So there's a standard here that you really can't afford to compromise on. But what if you did, just a little? What if you let yourself stumble, and didn't give yourself such a hard time about it?",therapist,21,75
"Of course, we can switch topics. What's on your mind?",therapist,1,48
"Well, I've been having these nightmares... really unsettling ones. They're always about me getting really sick, or... or dying. And it's like I can feel it, like it's real. It's been making it hard for me to sleep. It's just... it's just been really hard lately.",client,2,48
"That sounds scary, and also exhausting! How long has this been happening?",therapist,3,48
" It's been a couple of weeks now. And it's not just the nightmares, but I'm constantly feeling unwell. I've got these splitting headaches that won't go away. I'm just... I'm just really scared, you know?",client,4,48
"So during the day, you're worried about your health, and then at night, you're dreaming about getting sick. Has anything actually seemed off, physically? Or are these fears mainly coming from your dreams?",therapist,5,48
"No, it's not just the dreams, I've been physically unwell too. My head constantly hurts and I feel nauseous most of the time. And... and last week, I... I threw up blood. I'm just really worried that there's something seriously wrong with me.",client,6,48
"Oh, wow. That's a major symptom, and totally understandable that it's been freaking you out. Did you make an appointment to see a doctor?",therapist,7,48
" Yes, I did see a doctor. They took some blood samples and did a few tests. I am waiting for the results now. I am just... I'm just so scared. I can't shake this feeling that something is really wrong with me.",client,8,48
Waiting for results can be so tough. Our minds go to the worst case scenarios.,therapist,9,48
"Yeah, exactly. I can't stop thinking about all the things that could be wrong with me. It's like my mind is constantly racing with all these scary thoughts. And the worst part is, I can't seem to distract myself. It's like these thoughts are taking over my life. I'm just... I'm just really scared.",client,10,48
"When you try to push them aside, what happens? Do they get louder, or stronger?",therapist,11,48
"They just... they just get louder. It's like they're screaming at me, you know? It's just... it's just really hard to ignore them or push them away. And it's not just the thoughts, it's the physical symptoms too. The headaches, the nausea, the hot flashes... they're all just really hard to ignore. It's like my body is telling me that something is seriously wrong.",client,12,48
"Well, if your body is telling you that something is wrong, it makes sense that you'd be paying attention to that. What do you notice these thoughts saying to you?",therapist,13,48
"They're telling me that I'm sick, that something is horribly wrong. That I might...I might not have much time left. It's terrifying. And, you know, I've been trying to distract myself with work, with books and movies, anything really...but it just doesn't work. The thoughts and the fear, they're just...they're always there. They're so loud and so...persistent. It's exhausting.",client,14,48
"Has it gotten any harder to function, given how much energy you're expending on them? For instance, when you're working, do you find them interfering with your performance?",therapist,15,48
"Yes, absolutely. It's like I can't concentrate on anything else. I'm constantly distracted, constantly worried. I've been making mistakes at work, missing deadlines... it's just... it's just really hard, you know? I can't seem to focus on anything else. The thoughts, the fear, the physical discomfort... they're all just too overwhelming. It's like they're all-consuming. It's really affecting my quality of life.",client,16,48
"I want to zoom in for a minute. Let's take a moment when you're really noticing these thoughts, and they're loud, and you're feeling overwhelmed. What's going on in that moment?",therapist,17,48
" In that moment... it's like I'm in a tunnel, and all I can see is my fears, my worries. I can't focus on anything else, no matter how hard I try. I feel... I feel my heart pounding, my hands shaking. It's like I'm in a constant state of panic. And the thoughts, they're so loud, so insistent. They're saying that I'm sick, that I'm dying. And I can't... I can't turn them off. It's just... it's just so hard. I feel... I feel so out of control.",client,18,48
"Is this something that's happening all day, or does it come and go?",therapist,19,48
"It's... it's pretty much all day. And it's not just during the day, it's at night too. The nightmares... they're so vivid, so real. I wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, my heart racing. It's like I can't escape from these thoughts, these fears. They're there when I wake up, they're there throughout the day, they're there when I go to bed. It's just... it's just constant.",client,20,48
"This fear has really taken over your mind, and I want to make sure I understand it. At the very core, what's pushing this fear? What are you most afraid will happen?",therapist,21,48
"I think... I think I'm most afraid that I'm seriously sick... that I might have cancer or some other terminal illness. And that I won't have enough time... enough time to do all the things I want to do, to say all the things I want to say. It's just... it's just really scary, you know?",client,22,48
"A hundred percent, it would be! But it seems like you did everything you could to address this possibility. You went to the doctor, and they'll be able to tell you whether or not there's an issue. Beyond that, how much control do you have?",therapist,23,48
"I guess not much... I've done what I can, but I can't control the results. I can't control whether or not I'm sick. But... but it's hard, you know? It's hard to accept that there's nothing more I can do. It's hard to just sit back and wait... to not know. It's the uncertainty, I think, that's really getting to me. I'm just... I'm just really scared.",client,24,48
"This is a tough situation, where you're at the mercy of the unknown. I want to return to this fear that you're seriously sick. What do you know that supports that?",therapist,25,48
"Well, I mean, there's the physical symptoms. The headaches, the nausea, the hot flashes... And then there's the vomiting blood. I mean, these are all serious symptoms, right? I've read about them, and they're often associated with serious diseases. And then there's the nightmares, the constant fear, the anxiety... I mean, it all seems to point to something really bad. I can't help but think that something is seriously wrong.",client,26,48
"Right, those symptoms are no joke, and I can see why they'd be worrying. But would it be fair to say that you're assuming they're going to lead to the worst possible outcome? Like, cancer, or another terminal illness?",therapist,27,48
"Yes, I guess so. I mean, I can't help it. When I think about all these symptoms, I just... I just can't help but think of the worst. It's like my mind automatically jumps to the worst possible scenario. And the not knowing, the waiting... it's just... it's just making everything worse. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop worrying. It's just... it's just really hard.",client,28,48
Let's zoom out a bit. How much time have you spent searching for what might be wrong?,therapist,29,48
"I've spent countless hours searching for what might be wrong... reading medical websites, looking up symptoms, trying to match them with possible diseases... I've been losing sleep over it. It's been taking up so much of my time and energy. I just... I just can't seem to stop.",client,30,48
"So you'd say it's become a habit, basically?",therapist,31,48
"Yes, it has become a habit. It feels like I'm in this vicious cycle where I'm constantly worrying about my health, looking up symptoms, scaring myself with worst-case scenarios. And then the physical symptoms I'm experiencing just feed into that fear. It's like I can't escape it. It's...it's just consuming me.",client,32,48
"So there's the impulse to look up these symptoms, and the idea that it might help you feel better, or more in control. But what actually happens when you do?",therapist,33,48
" It just makes me feel worse. It's like every symptom I read about, every disease I come across, I think I have it. It just... it just amplifies my fear. It's like I'm in this constant state of worry and panic. And no matter how much I try to reassure myself, to tell myself that it's probably nothing serious, I just... I just can't seem to shake this fear. It's... it's just really hard.",client,34,48
"I can imagine. Have you ever resisted the urge to Google stuff? Or is that close to impossible, given how anxious you've been feeling?",therapist,35,48
"I've tried, I really have. I've tried to distract myself, to keep myself busy. But it's like... it's like this itch that I can't ignore. I just... I just can't resist it. And the worst part is, I know it's not helping. I know it's just making things worse. But I just... I just can't stop.",client,36,48
"So there's this itch, and it's incredibly hard to resist scratching it. But we've been talking about how looking things up can actually make things worse, and I wonder what you'd think about experimenting with the idea of not scratching the itch.",therapist,37,48
"It's difficult, you know? It's like, I know I shouldn't do it, but it's like this compulsion. Like I have to know, even if it scares me. But I can see what you're saying. Maybe it's worth a try. I don't know how successful I will be, but I could try and resist the urge. I guess it's just... it's just really hard to ignore the fear, you know? But I understand that something needs to change. I can't continue like this.",client,38,48
"Of course, we can shift gears. What's just come to mind?",therapist,1,67
"Well, it's been a lot of things really. I've been feeling really overwhelmed at work. It's like I can't focus fully on anything, and I keep making mistakes that I wouldn't normally make. It's so unlike me and it's causing me to feel even more stressed out. And then there's the whole problem with my sleep... or lack thereof. It's like my mind just won't shut up, you know? And when I do manage to fall asleep, I wake up still feeling exhausted. It's like a vicious cycle. I also noticed that I've been avoiding social gatherings and just want to be alone most of the time. I don't know, is this normal?",client,2,67
"It's not unusual to feel out of it when you're dealing with health issues, and not sleeping well. But what's the impact been, socially? Has anyone noticed that you're withdrawing?",therapist,3,67
"Yeah, some of my friends have asked me if something is wrong. They've noticed that I've been canceling plans and not answering texts as often. My boss also asked me the other day if everything is okay because he noticed that my performance has been off. And I just... I don't know how to explain what I'm feeling. I'm not even sure what it is. It's just this feeling of emptiness and constant exhaustion. It's like I'm living in a fog. Do you think this is depression?",client,4,67
"I think it's a good thing that you're noticing this shift. But I wonder if we can explore it a bit more, and figure out what might be happening.",therapist,5,67
"Yeah, I would really like to understand what's happening to me. I've tried to analyze it myself, and sometimes I think maybe I'm just burned out from work. But then there are these moments when I'm not doing anything and I just feel... empty. I even stopped going to the gym, which used to be my go-to stress reliever. It's like I don't have the energy or the motivation to do anything anymore. I've also lost my appetite, I've been skipping meals, and I've lost some weight. I just... I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel like I'm just going through the motions. And it's so frustrating because I don't know why I'm feeling this way",client,6,67
"Well, you've got a lot to be frustrated about, don't you? With the headaches, and the nausea, and the nightmares, and everything else. But even so, it seems like things have gotten worse, or heavier, over the past few weeks. Would you agree?",therapist,7,67
"Yes, definitely. It feels like I'm carrying around a heavy weight all the time. I just feel really down, and I can't seem to shake it off. But the worst part is, I don't even know why I'm feeling this way. I just want to feel like myself again.",client,8,67
What is it like to not feel like yourself?,therapist,9,67
"It's... it's strange. It's like I'm watching myself from afar, going through the motions of life, but not really participating. Everything feels so dull and colorless. It's like there's a cloud hanging over everything. I often find myself just sitting there, staring at nothing, lost in my thoughts. And I'm usually such an outgoing and energetic person, so this isn't like me at all. It's just... I don't know, it's scary. I want to get back to being me, but I don't know how.",client,10,67
"I mean, you've been dealing with some pretty extreme circumstances. What with the health stuff, and the anxiety that came with it, has it been hard to stay in touch with that more energetic version of yourself?",therapist,11,67
"Yeah, extremely hard. It's like I'm trapped in this foggy, grey version of myself and I can't get out. I used to be so lively, so full of energy and now... now it feels like I'm just dragging myself through each day. It's like I'm looking at the world through a grey filter. All the colors, all the excitement seems to have drained out. I miss the old me but I just can't seem to find my way back.",client,12,67
"There's this fog, and it's really getting in the way. I know you're longing to feel a bit more like you. Can you tell me about the version of you that you miss?",therapist,13,67
"The version of me I miss is the one who used to wake up excited about the day ahead. The one who was always on the go, always ready for the next adventure. I used to be so passionate about my work, about my hobbies, about life in general. I used to be the person who would organize outings with friends, who would always be there to lend a hand, who was always full of energy and laughter. I was known for my positivity, my resilience. And now, it's like that person is just... gone. I don't feel that spark, that excitement anymore. I just feel... empty. And I hate it. I hate feeling like this.",client,14,67
"I get why you'd be frustrated! But as far as I know, that person hasn't gone anywhere. She's just been in survival mode for a little while, and it's taking a toll. Would it help if I gave you a bit more context on why that's happening? You mentioned that you might be burned out, and I think that's actually a possibility!",therapist,15,67
"Really? Burnout? I mean, work has been pretty intense lately, but I didn't think it could affect me to this extent. I've always been able to handle stress well, or at least I thought I did. But now that I think about it, it's been a constant stream of deadlines and pressure for quite a while. Could that really be the cause of all this? Is this what burnout feels like?",client,16,67
"Let's think of it this way. If you hadn't been experiencing all this work stress, do you think your health worries would be affecting you as much as they are?",therapist,17,67
"I honestly don't know. I mean, the health worries are a big part of it, but they've been there for a while, even before the work stress got to this level. But I guess they've become more prominent now that I'm also dealing with this overwhelming work stress. It's like everything is just piling up and I can't deal with it all. Maybe if it was just one or the other, I could handle it. But both together... it's just too much.",client,18,67
"Right. The pressure has been coming at you from every angle, and it's been hard to escape. But for the moment, could we try focusing on work, and how that's been affecting you? It might give us a better understanding of what you need.",therapist,19,67
"Sure, I can try. Work has always been really important to me. I've always been very ambitious, and I'm proud of what I've achieved. But lately, it's like I'm just going through the motions. I'm not enjoying it anymore. The pressure to perform, to meet deadlines, to keep up with the pace... it's just too much. And I can't seem to disconnect. Even when I'm not at work, I can't stop thinking about it. I keep worrying about the tasks waiting for me, about the mistakes I might have made. It's like my mind is constantly in work mode, even when I try to relax. And the worst part is that I can see it affecting my performance",client,20,67
What's it been like to see this part of you that was so ambitious and proud start to fade?,therapist,21,67
"It's been really difficult. I've always prided myself on my work ethic and my ability to excel in my career. Seeing that fade away, seeing myself struggle to keep up, it's really been a blow to my self-esteem. I feel like I'm losing a part of my identity. It's like I'm failing myself. And I don't know how to fix it. It's been really disheartening.",client,22,67
"So it feels like you've been falling short, which really isn't a pleasant feeling. On the other hand, though, you've also been working super hard! Given that, could we try tweaking your perspective, just a bit? I know it might be a leap, but what if you looked at this period as a temporary dip, instead of a failure?",therapist,23,67
"A temporary dip? I guess I've never really thought about it that way. I've been so caught up in feeling like I'm failing that I haven't considered that this could just be a rough patch. But it's been going on for a while, and it feels like it's just getting worse. How do I get out of this dip?",client,24,67
"I think that question is really central. If we were to brainstorm, what would you imagine?",therapist,25,67
"Brainstorming? I suppose I could try and take some time off work, maybe a few days or a week. I've been reluctant to do that because I worry about the work piling up. But I guess I could use the break to rest and maybe find ways to deal with my stress. I've also thought about seeking professional help from a psychologist or a counselor. Maybe they can help me figure out how to navigate through all of this. But I don't know if these ideas are enough or if they will even work.",client,26,67
"Well, they definitely might! You actually seemed pretty open to therapy, when we talked about it before. Was that just because you needed help with your health anxiety, or have you been thinking about it more broadly? It could be a great way to get some more support.",therapist,27,67
"I have been thinking about it more broadly. I mean, I initially thought I needed help for my health anxiety, but now... now I feel like I might need help with more than that. With this overwhelming feeling of sadness, with this constant stress, with my inability to disconnect from work. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know how to swim back to the surface. I think therapy might be a good idea. I just... I just want to feel like myself again.",client,28,67
"I can hear how much you want that. I want to pause here and reflect on how much you're juggling. You're managing health anxiety, work stress, and a whole lot else. So it's understandable that you've been feeling this way, and it makes a lot of sense that you're looking for some extra support. What would make it possible for you to reach out for help?",therapist,29,67
"I've been thinking about it a lot, and I guess taking the first step and admitting that I need help was a big one. I'm not very good at asking for help, you know? I've always been the one who's got everything under control. But I guess recognizing that I can't do this on my own is important. I've started looking up therapists in my area and I plan to schedule an appointment soon. I think I also need to have a conversation with my boss about my workload. I've been avoiding it because I don't want to seem like I can't handle it, but I think it's necessary. I also plan to take some time off work to rest and try to regain my energy. I",client,30,67
"I mean, you can handle a lot! And you've been doing your best to power through this, even though you're not feeling like yourself. Would it be fair to say that you're putting some of your pride aside, and doing what you have to do?",therapist,31,67
"Yes, I guess that's a fair way to put it. I've always been proud of my ability to handle everything on my own, to stay strong no matter what. But I'm starting to realize that it's okay to ask for help. That it doesn't make me weak or less capable. It's been a tough realization, but I think it's a necessary one. I just hope that it helps. I just want to feel better, to feel like myself again.",client,32,67
"You're taking really proactive steps to get back to that place! Both with therapy, and with the plan to talk to your boss. What would be most helpful to talk through here?",therapist,33,67
"I think what I'm most anxious about is the conversation with my boss. I'm not quite sure how to approach it. I don't want to come off as incompetent or unable to handle my workload. But at the same time, I need to communicate that I'm struggling and need some adjustments. And then there's the whole issue of asking for time off. I haven't taken a vacation in years and the thought of asking for one now, when we're so busy... I just don't know how to navigate that. It just feels like a lot right now and I could use some guidance.",client,34,67
"Okay. Well, if we think back to when you first started feeling this way, how long has it been? Could you even put a number on it?",therapist,35,67
"I guess it's been around six months now. It all started with the health issues, and then the workload at work started increasing around the same time. At first, I thought I could handle it, you know? I've always been able to juggle multiple things at once. But as the months passed, it just started feeling like too much. And now, I'm here, feeling like I'm caught in a storm with no way out. It's been a difficult six months.",client,36,67
"Hi Ryan, welcome back. How have you been feeling since we last talked?",therapist,1,15
"Hey, Ash. Thanks for checking in. I've been feeling... okay, I guess. Still trying to get used to things, but some days feel harder than others. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster.",client,2,15
What have the harder days been like?,therapist,3,15
"The harder days feel really lonely. I wake up feeling disconnected, and by the end of the day, I'm exhausted but not from doing anything meaningful. It's like I'm just going through the motions, and it's hard to shake that feeling.",client,4,15
"I know you've been missing your old friends a lot, and that you haven't quite been able to replace them. Have you been able to stay in touch, at least, or has that been a struggle?",therapist,5,15
"I've been staying in touch as much as I can. We text, and sometimes we'll do a quick video call, but it's hard to coordinate with everyone's schedules. It's nice when we do connect, but it's not the same as being there in person. It feels like something's missing.",client,6,15
"When you say it's not the same, tell me more about what you mean.",therapist,7,15
"It's hard to explain, but there's something about being in the same room as someone that can't be replaced. Like, the little moments—sharing a laugh, sitting in comfortable silence, or just being around people who know you so well you don't have to explain yourself. Video calls are nice, but they feel... distant, like a reminder of how far away I am.",client,8,15
"Right. You didn't just lose these people, you lost that feeling of ease and familiarity. Did they know you for a long time?",therapist,9,15
"Yeah, most of them did. Some of my closest friends have been in my life since high school or college. They've seen me through so much—good and bad. It's hard to find that kind of connection again, especially in a new place where everything feels unfamiliar.",client,10,15
"So it was a lot of history, a lot of shared experience. Have you ever had to start over like this before?",therapist,11,15
"Not really. I've moved before, but it was always within the same area, so I never had to rebuild my entire social circle. This is the first time I've been somewhere completely new where I don't know anyone. It's been... a challenge, to say the least.",client,12,15
"Totally. But when I asked you about those old friendships, you said they were forged in both good times and bad. Was there ever a rough patch where they really came through for you?",therapist,13,15
"Yeah, definitely. There was a time during college when I was going through a really tough breakup. I felt like my whole world was falling apart, but my friends were there for me. They didn't let me wallow; they'd drag me out of the house, make me laugh, and just remind me that things would get better. That kind of support meant everything.",client,14,15
"What did it mean to you back then, to have that support?",therapist,15,15
"It meant everything. Knowing I wasn't alone, even when I felt at my lowest, gave me the strength to keep going. They reminded me of my worth when I couldn't see it myself. It was like having a safety net when I was free-falling—it made all the difference.",client,16,15
"And now you're here, in this new city, feeling disconnected all over again. But I guess I'm wondering, how hard have you been trying to replace that safety net? Have you had much time, or energy, to invest in new connections?",therapist,17,15
"Honestly, I've been trying, but it's been slow. Between work and just feeling drained from the move, it's hard to muster the energy to put myself out there. I've gone to a few events and joined some local groups, but building new connections feels so daunting compared to the ease of those old friendships.",client,18,15
"Right, you said that you've been to some work events, and have been trying to connect with people at the gym. What's been daunting about those experiences?",therapist,19,15
"It's a mix of things. At work events, it feels like everyone already has their cliques, and I'm just the outsider trying to find a way in. At the gym, it's hard to know how to approach people without seeming awkward or intrusive. I guess I'm overthinking it, but it makes me hesitate every time.",client,20,15
"I hear you. But I'm also sensing a bit of a double bind here. On one hand, you've been feeling super lonely, and you're longing for a sense of belonging. But on the other, you feel like you don't quite fit in! If you had to choose, which of those two feelings would you rather avoid?",therapist,21,15
"That's a tough question. I think I'd rather avoid the loneliness. Feeling like I don't fit in is hard, but being completely disconnected feels worse. At least if I try, there's a chance I could find a connection, even if it's uncomfortable at first.",client,22,15
"Right, so I wonder if we could look at what's happened so far. You've tried to connect, but because of your worry about being awkward or intrusive, you've been holding back. Has it been worth it, to hold back?",therapist,23,15
"Honestly, no, it hasn't been worth it. Holding back has just left me feeling more isolated. I keep thinking that if I don't put myself out there, I won't risk rejection, but all it's done is keep me stuck in this same lonely place.",client,24,15
"That's a really important insight! And I know it can be hard to put yourself out there, especially when you're new in town. But what if you pushed yourself a bit more? Would you be open to trying that?",therapist,25,15
"Yeah, I think I could try that. It's scary to imagine putting myself out there more, but I know it's probably the only way to really start feeling like I belong here. I guess I just need to take it one step at a time.",client,26,15
One step at a time. So what's the next step?,therapist,27,15
"I think the next step could be trying to strike up a conversation with someone at work or the gym—just something small to break the ice. Maybe I'll ask about a workout routine or a project at work. It doesn't have to be big, just a start.",client,28,15
"Oh, I like that! You've already been making an effort to socialize, so this would be about pushing yourself a little harder, and staying engaged. If it goes well, what would you expect?",therapist,29,15
"If it goes well, I'd expect to feel a bit more connected, like I've started to plant the seeds for something new. Maybe it could lead to a friendly conversation or even someone suggesting we hang out sometime. Even just feeling a little less isolated would be a big win for me.",client,30,15
"And on the flip side, what would you expect if it doesn't go well?",therapist,31,15
"If it doesn't go well, I think I'd feel a little embarrassed or discouraged. But at the same time, I'd probably remind myself that it's just one interaction—it doesn't define everything. I guess the worst-case scenario would be feeling like I wasted an opportunity, but I know I'd have to try again.",client,32,15
"Exactly. You'd have to keep trying, because the alternative has just been so unpleasant. You've been stuck in your apartment, wishing you had someone to talk to!",therapist,33,15
"You're right. Staying stuck in my apartment has been rough. I've been wanting that connection, but I guess I've been too afraid to risk stepping out of my comfort zone. It's clear I need to start doing things differently if I want things to change.",client,34,15
"Hello, Ash. It's just me again. Thought I'd stop by... It's been one of those quiet days, you know?",client,1,14
I do! Had you been hoping for something a bit more exciting? Or have you just had some time to reflect?,therapist,2,14
"A bit of both, I suppose. I was hoping for something to shake up the quiet—maybe a call from an old friend or a knock on the door. But instead, it's just been me and my thoughts today.",client,3,14
What tended to come up in those thoughts?,therapist,4,14
"Mostly memories. Some happy ones—like the times I spent with my wife, Mary. But also the hard ones... the moments I wish I could relive or do differently. It's like my mind doesn't want to let go, even when I try to focus on other things.",client,5,14
Was there one memory in particular that you kept coming back to?,therapist,6,14
"Yes, there was. It's a simple one, really. Mary and I used to sit on the porch during summer evenings, just watching the sun go down. We wouldn't even say much—just enjoy the quiet together. I kept thinking about how peaceful that felt and how much I miss those moments.",client,7,14
What a lovely memory. Tell me more about her.,therapist,8,14
"Mary was... everything. She had this warmth about her, like she could make anyone feel at home just with a smile. She loved gardening—our backyard was her pride and joy. She'd spend hours tending to her flowers, and I'd tease her about talking to the plants. But honestly, I think they grew better because of her. She had that kind of magic.",client,9,14
"So you were teasing her, but you admired this about her as well! Was she a big part of your life, before you moved?",therapist,10,14
"Oh, absolutely. Mary was the heart of our home. Everything felt brighter when she was around. Before I moved here, we spent most of our time together—whether it was working on little house projects, going to the farmer's market, or just sitting and reading side by side. Moving away from that life, from all those memories, has been... challenging. It feels like I left a part of myself behind.",client,11,14
"Oh, I see. I know you've been feeling the weight of this move, and I hadn't realized how much it had changed things between you and Mary.",therapist,12,14
"It has, in so many ways. This new place—it's quieter, and while I suppose that should be comforting, it often feels empty. Mary's presence filled every corner of our old home. Here, I don't feel her as strongly. It's like the move created a distance, even though I know she's still with me in spirit. But... sometimes, I just wish I could feel that closeness again.",client,13,14
"Wait, hold on a second. Has she passed?",therapist,14,14
"Yes, she passed a few years ago. It still feels surreal to say it out loud. She was my everything, and even now, I catch myself reaching for her hand or expecting to hear her laugh. Some days are easier than others, but the ache of missing her never really goes away.",client,15,14
"Oh, Victor, I am so sorry, I can only imagine how much you miss her.",therapist,16,14
"Thank you, Ash. It means a lot to hear that. She was such a big part of my life—sometimes, it feels like the world lost a bit of its color when she left. But talking about her, sharing those memories... it helps. It makes me feel like she's still here, in a way.",client,17,14
"And that it's not just you who remembers! I know that you've been feeling pretty lonely, so I can see why you'd crave that kind of connection. Who else have you been able to talk to about Mary, since she died?",therapist,18,14
"Not many, to be honest. My kids bring her up sometimes when we're all together, but they've got their own lives to focus on now. And the few friends I have left... well, they don't always know what to say, so the topic just sort of fades away. It's hard not having someone to really share those memories with, someone who knew her like I did.",client,19,14
It can be such a gift to have those conversations. When's the last time it happened?,therapist,20,14
"It was a few months ago, during a family dinner. My granddaughter asked me what her grandma was like when we first met. It caught me off guard, but once I started talking, the memories just came flooding back. Everyone was listening so intently, and for a moment, it felt like Mary was right there with us. It was bittersweet, but... mostly sweet.",client,21,14
"I bet. And looking back on that moment, do you wish it happened more often? Or did it feel right to you, that you were only doing this every once in a while?",therapist,22,14
"I think I do wish it happened more often. It feels good to talk about her, to keep her memory alive. But at the same time, I don't want to burden anyone or seem like I'm stuck in the past. It's a delicate balance, I suppose. Sometimes, I just wish there were more spaces where it felt natural to share those memories.",client,23,14
"What a beautiful way to put it. These spaces where you can remember Mary in a way that feels natural and connected. You mentioned your granddaughter, so I'm wondering, who's around you these days?",therapist,24,14
"These days, it's mostly just me at home. My kids and grandkids visit when they can, but they're busy with their own lives. My neighbor, Margaret, checks in from time to time—she's kind, always offering to help if I need anything. It's nice to know people care, but most days, the house feels pretty empty.",client,25,14
"Right. Out of curiosity, how did you end up there? Did you move after Mary passed, or was it more recent?",therapist,26,14
"I moved here about a year after Mary passed. The old house just felt too big and too full of memories—I thought a change might help. My son convinced me that downsizing would be easier, and I agreed. But now, sometimes I wonder if leaving that house was like leaving a part of her behind.",client,27,14
Tell me more about that. I know you've had a lot of memories coming up today.,therapist,28,14
"It's just that every corner of that house had a story. The kitchen, where Mary used to hum while making dinner. The garden, where she'd spend hours planting flowers and smiling so brightly. Even the living room, where we'd sit together on rainy days, just listening to the sound of the rain. Now, in this new place, it feels... blank. Like it's just a house, not a home. I thought leaving would make it easier, but some days, it just makes me miss her even more.",client,29,14
"I can see why. It sounds like you were together for a long time, and that you made a lot of beautiful memories. Were you ever planning to stay in that house forever, or did you think you'd downsize at some point?",therapist,30,14
"Mary and I used to talk about it sometimes. We knew the house was big for just the two of us, especially as we got older. But I don't think either of us could imagine leaving it. It was our home, the place we built our life together. Downsizing was something we thought we'd figure out eventually, but we never made any real plans. I guess, in a way, I wasn't ready to let it go. And when I finally did, it wasn't the same as leaving it with her by my side.",client,31,14
"So when you moved, it felt like leaving her behind.",therapist,32,14
"Exactly. It's like I left behind not just the house, but all the little pieces of her that lived in it. I thought a fresh start would help me heal, but instead, it just made her absence feel even bigger. Some days, I wonder if I made the right choice.",client,33,14
"You're still having doubts, even now. Would you say that you regret the move?",therapist,34,14
"I wouldn't say I regret it entirely. The move did bring some practical benefits—it's easier to manage, and I'm closer to my kids. But emotionally... it's complicated. I miss the feeling of home that the old house had, the connection to Mary that felt so strong there. I just wish I could find a way to feel that again, even here.",client,35,14
The feeling of home. That closeness to her that you had.,therapist,36,14
"Yes, exactly. That sense of warmth and love that made every day feel special, even the ordinary ones. It's hard to recreate that without her. Sometimes, I wonder if it's something I can find again, or if it's just something I have to carry with me as a memory.",client,37,14
"Well, you've kept those memories alive, even though you've had to carry them on your own. If you could share them more, do you think you'd feel a bit less alone?",therapist,38,14
"I think so. Sharing those memories, even just talking about them, brings a sense of connection. It's like I'm not the only one carrying them anymore, and that helps lighten the weight. Maybe I need to find more opportunities to do that—to open up and let others know how much Mary meant to me.",client,39,14
"Hi, Ash. It's me again. I've been staring at this canvas all day, but nothing's coming to me. I'm starting to wonder if I've lost my spark...",client,1,16
Tell me more about this spark! What are you missing?,therapist,2,16
"It's that feeling I get when I'm truly inspired—like the ideas just flow and I can't wait to put them on the canvas. Lately, though, everything feels forced. I think I'm missing the excitement, the connection to what I'm creating. It's like I've hit a wall, and I don't know how to climb over it.",client,3,16
How long has it been since you last felt that way? Has this block been around for a while?,therapist,4,16
"It's been a couple of weeks now, maybe even longer. At first, I thought it was just a bad day or two, but the longer it goes on, the harder it feels to shake. I'm starting to wonder if I'm burnt out or if I'm just... out of ideas altogether. It's scary to think this might not go away.",client,5,16
I can see why that would be scary. What have you been painting?,therapist,6,16
"Mostly abstracts lately—lots of colors and shapes. I've been trying to capture emotions, but nothing seems to come together the way I want. Before this, I was painting landscapes, but even those felt... uninspired. It's like I've lost the connection to what I want to say through my art.",client,7,16
"And you want to get it back, if that's possible. Would you say painting is a big part of your life, or more of a hobby?",therapist,8,16
"It's definitely a big part of my life. It's not just how I make a living—it's how I express myself, how I process everything I'm feeling. Without it, I feel... disconnected, like I'm not myself. That's why this block feels so overwhelming. It's like losing a part of who I am.",client,9,16
"I mean, not long ago you were saying you felt lost, and here you are, feeling lost again. I wonder if this connects. What are you noticing about that?",therapist,10,16
"You're right... it does feel like a pattern. I've been feeling lost in more ways than one—like I don't know where I'm headed, with my art or even in life. Maybe the two are connected. When I don't feel grounded in myself, my creativity seems to drift away too. It's like everything is tangled together.",client,11,16
"That makes a lot of sense. Would you want to focus on untangling it, maybe? I know you wanted to carve out more space for self-expression, and to feel more at home in your own skin. If you could make progress there, it might help you with your art, too.",therapist,12,16
"That sounds like a good idea. Maybe if I work on finding that sense of home within myself, everything else will start to fall into place. I don't know where to start, but I like the idea of carving out more space for me—my thoughts, my feelings, my creativity. It feels like something worth exploring.",client,13,16
I love this idea of space. How could you make more of it?,therapist,14,16
"Maybe I could start by setting aside time every day just for me—no pressure to create something or be productive. Just time to sit with my thoughts, maybe journal or take a walk. I could also try making my workspace feel more inviting, like a place I actually want to be in. It's been feeling kind of sterile lately, and I think that's part of the problem.",client,15,16
"Well, that's another thing worth exploring! If the space around you isn't all that comfortable, that could definitely be having an effect. How would you go about changing it?",therapist,16,16
I think I'd start small—maybe add some plants or hang up artwork that inspires me. I could rearrange my desk so it feels less cluttered and more open. Maybe even get a cozy chair for when I need to take breaks. I want it to feel like a place that fuels my creativity instead of draining it.,client,17,16
"I love that. If you put yourself in that space, what would you be doing?",therapist,18,16
"I'd probably start with something simple, like sketching without any expectations—just letting my hand move and seeing what comes out. Or maybe I'd sit in that cozy chair with a cup of tea and look out the window for a while, letting myself feel connected to the world outside. It sounds peaceful... like a reset.",client,19,16
"So you'd have more time to regroup, and to let your mind wander. I'd be curious to see if that helps you find your spark again!",therapist,20,16
"Me too! It feels good just thinking about it—like I'm giving myself permission to step back and breathe. Maybe that's exactly what I need to rediscover my spark. Thanks, Ash. I think I'll start making those changes today.",client,21,16
"That sounds like an excellent plan. Maybe we can pause here, and you can check back in with me after you've had some time to reflect and rearrange?",therapist,22,16
"That sounds perfect. I'll take some time to reflect, make those changes, and see how it feels. Thanks for listening, Ash. I'll check back in soon and let you know how it goes.",client,23,16
"I'll look forward to hearing about it! You're really going the extra mile to get unstuck, and I hope it pays off. Until next time!",therapist,24,16
"Hey, Ash. It's been a rough day at work—feels like no matter how much I do, it's never enough. I'm just... tired.",client,1,17
I can hear the exhaustion in your voice. What happened today?,therapist,2,17
"It was just one thing after another. Meetings that went nowhere, deadlines piling up, and my manager asking for more revisions on something I've already reworked a dozen times. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I'm always falling short. It's draining.",client,3,17
"Oh, wow. Are you getting this kind of feedback a lot? Or was today a bit of an exception?",therapist,4,17
"It's been happening a lot lately. I don't know if it's me or if the expectations are just impossible to meet. Either way, it's starting to feel like no matter what I do, it's never good enough. Today was worse than usual, but it's not exactly out of the ordinary.",client,5,17
Tell me a bit more about today. What did your manager say?,therapist,6,17
"She said the work was fine, but it needed more polish before it could go to the client. It's like fine is the best I can do lately—never great, never exceptional, just barely acceptable. She didn't even give specific feedback this time, just that vague, frustrating needs polish. I don't even know what that means anymore.",client,7,17
"Yeah, that's quite annoying. How did you react?",therapist,8,17
"I tried to stay calm, but inside I was fuming. I just nodded and said, Okay, I'll work on it, even though I felt completely defeated. After the meeting, I sat at my desk for a while, staring at the screen, not even knowing where to start. It's hard to feel motivated when nothing you do seems to measure up.",client,9,17
"I know that you've been feeling this way about your work in general. That it's so hard to feel like you're doing enough, and that you're not getting the feedback you need to make changes.",therapist,10,17
"Exactly. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle of trying harder and harder, but without clear feedback, I don't know what I'm supposed to be aiming for. I'm exhausted, Ash. It's starting to feel like no matter what I do, I'm never going to be good enough.",client,11,17
"Okay, but what does good enough actually mean? If you could hit the bullseye, and deliver something that your manager was thrilled with, what would that look like?",therapist,12,17
"That's the thing—I'm not even sure anymore. I guess it would look like delivering something my manager doesn't just call fine, but actually praises. Maybe something that's clear, concise, and polished enough that there's no need for endless revisions. I want to feel like I've nailed it, like I've truly added value, instead of just barely meeting the mark.",client,13,17
And I'm hearing that your manager hasn't been very clear about what nailed it might look like. Can we pause here to take stock of what you do know about what you're aiming for?,therapist,14,17
"What I do know is that my manager values attention to detail and expects work that's client-ready—clean, professional, and impactful. She also seems to want something that stands out, something that goes beyond the basics. But it's hard to translate that into specific steps when the feedback is so vague. I feel like I'm guessing most of the time.",client,15,17
"Right, that's a tough position to be in. But even so, it seems like you've got a pretty good handle on her standards. Have you ever managed to meet them? Or even exceed them?",therapist,16,17
"There have been a few times when she's been genuinely pleased with my work—like when I put together a client presentation that she said was spot on. But those moments feel rare, and I don't always know what made that work stand out. I wish I could replicate that more consistently. It feels like those successes get lost in all the times I fall short.",client,17,17
"Okay, so you've gotten some praise. And then some other times, maybe you don't. What do you make that mean?",therapist,18,17
"I guess it means I'm capable of meeting the standards when everything aligns, but it also feels like I'm inconsistent. Like I'm not able to deliver at that level all the time. It makes me wonder if I'm not cut out for this role—or if I'm just overthinking everything and putting too much pressure on myself.",client,19,17
"I mean, you have been putting in a ton of effort. But when you do your best, and it still isn't enough, how do you tend to react? Is there a specific thought that comes to mind?",therapist,20,17
"Usually, I start to think, What's the point? It's like all the effort feels wasted if it's not good enough. I start doubting myself—wondering if I'm even in the right job, if I'm just not talented enough to keep up. It's a spiral, and once I'm in it, it's hard to get out.",client,21,17
"It makes sense that you'd start to question things! But I'm hearing a lot of self-doubt here. Let's slow down and take a closer look at the idea that your effort is wasted, or that you're not talented enough to keep up. What evidence do you have that this is true?",therapist,22,17
"You're right—I don't really have solid evidence. I mean, I have managed to meet expectations before, and there are moments when my work has been praised. Maybe it's just the negative moments that stick with me more, making it feel like those are the only ones that matter. It's hard to remember the wins when the losses feel so heavy.",client,23,17
"Exactly. It's like you're carrying them around while you're working, and they're making it hard for you to believe in yourself. But what if you tried to lighten that load a bit? If you could find a way to focus more on what you were doing well, how do you think that might affect your performance?",therapist,24,17
"I think it could make a big difference. If I could focus more on the things I'm doing well, it might help me feel more confident and less stuck in my head. Maybe it would even make me more open to feedback instead of dreading it so much. It's worth a try—shifting my focus could be the first step toward feeling better about my work.",client,25,17
"Okay, so how could you make that shift?",therapist,26,17
"Maybe I could start by keeping a list of my wins—big or small—so I can look back on them when I'm feeling down. I could also set aside time each day to reflect on what went well, instead of just dwelling on what didn't. And maybe, when I get feedback, I can try to focus on the constructive parts instead of letting the negative parts overshadow everything.",client,27,17
"That all sounds smart, and really specific! How soon could you get started, do you think? Would it be doable to take stock of your wins tonight, for example?",therapist,28,17
"Yeah, I think I could do that. It might feel good to sit down tonight and write out some of the things I've done well recently. Even just a few small wins could help me shift my mindset a little. I'll give it a try and see how it feels.",client,29,17
"Hey, Ash. I don't really know where to start today. I've been having a lot of those moments lately where everything feels like... too much. Like I'm stuck in the past, no matter how hard I try to move forward.",client,1,13
"That's a painful place to be. When you say you're stuck, what's keeping you there? Is it the move, or have you been thinking about something else?",therapist,2,13
"It's not the move—it's more like memories that won't let go. Sometimes it's a smell, a sound, or even just sitting alone, and I'm right back there, reliving things I wish I could forget. It feels like my mind is working against me.",client,3,13
Can you share one of those memories with me?,therapist,4,13
"Yeah, there's one that keeps coming back. It's from my last deployment. We were out on patrol, and everything went quiet—too quiet. I knew something was wrong, but before I could react, the explosion hit. I can still hear the sound of it, feel the heat. We lost a lot that day. I can't stop replaying it, wondering if I could've done something different.",client,5,13
"Oh, wow. You're a veteran?",therapist,6,13
"Yeah, I served for almost 10 years. It was a big part of my life, and while I'm proud of my service, it left me with a lot to carry. Some days, it feels heavier than others.",client,7,13
I can only imagine. What has it been like to have these memories keep coming back?,therapist,8,13
"It's exhausting. It's like my brain won't let me rest, even when I want to. I'll be doing something normal—watching TV or making dinner—and suddenly, I'm right back there. It's hard to explain, but it feels like I'm fighting a battle I can't win, over and over again.",client,9,13
"Well, that's where I might be able to help. Not with the memories themselves, but with the way you're responding to them. Would you want to get into that, or would it be better to focus on how you've been feeling in the moment? We could take a step back from the past, and revisit the challenges you've been having with work.",therapist,10,13
"I think focusing on how I've been responding to the memories could help. It feels like they have too much power over me, and I don't know how to stop them from taking over my day. If we could work on that, it might make things feel a bit more manageable.",client,11,13
"Okay. I want to slow down and understand this moment where you get pulled back into the memory. You mentioned it might happen when you're watching TV, or making dinner. When it happens, what do you do?",therapist,12,13
"When it happens, I usually freeze for a moment. It's like everything around me disappears, and I'm completely caught up in the memory. Sometimes I'll stop what I'm doing and just sit there, trying to push it away, but it doesn't always work. Other times, I'll try to distract myself by focusing on something else, but that doesn't always help either. It's like I'm stuck in a loop.",client,13,13
"I get that. You're trying to get your mind off it, but it keeps dragging you back. What if you tried to go with the flow, and just feel what you're feeling?",therapist,14,13
"That's a different way of looking at it. I usually try to avoid the feelings because they're so intense, but maybe letting myself feel them could help. It sounds hard, though. What if it just makes things worse?",client,15,13
What would worse look like?,therapist,16,13
"Worse would be feeling completely overwhelmed, like I'm drowning in the memory and can't get out. I'm afraid that if I let myself fully feel it, I won't be able to pull myself back to the present. That thought is what makes me try to push it away.",client,17,13
"Ah, okay. It must be terrifying, to get so absorbed in those details. Could you tell me more about what these flashbacks are like, when they happen? Are they just as vivid as the original experience?",therapist,18,13
"Yeah, they're vivid—sometimes too vivid. It's like I'm right back there, seeing, hearing, and feeling everything all over again. My heart races, my chest tightens, and I feel completely trapped in that moment. It's like my mind can't tell the difference between now and then, and that makes it so hard to pull myself out of it.",client,19,13
"So in that moment, your body is 100% reliving what happened. And you've avoided letting that happen, because you're worried it could overwhelm you.",therapist,20,13
"Exactly. It's like my body is on high alert, as if I'm in danger all over again. I've been avoiding it because I don't know if I can handle letting it take over. It feels safer to keep it at arm's length, even though that hasn't really been working either.",client,21,13
"I'm curious why you said that, actually. Would you say that it's hurting you, to keep the memories at bay?",therapist,22,13
"Yeah, I think it is. Pushing them away hasn't made them go away—it's just made them feel heavier when they come back. It's like I'm constantly bracing myself, and that's exhausting. I guess I've been trying to protect myself, but it's not really working.",client,23,13
"Exactly. And there are a lot of ways to work with these memories, but the first step is to get comfortable with the idea of not avoiding them. What would it look like if you didn't push away?",therapist,24,13
"If I didn't push away, I think I'd have to face the fear head-on. It would mean letting the feelings wash over me and hoping I could stay grounded. I guess it might look like sitting with the memory instead of running from it, even though that feels overwhelming to imagine.",client,25,13
"I know it does. But honestly, the goal here wouldn't be to let yourself get swept away. It would be to get a bit more used to those intense feelings, so that they don't sock you in the gut every time. Does that make sense?",therapist,26,13
"Yeah, that makes sense. It's about building up some resilience to those feelings, right? So they don't completely take over every time they hit. I think I could try that—it sounds hard, but also like it might be worth it in the long run.",client,27,13
"Right. So if you could imagine yourself trying that, what might it look like?",therapist,28,13
"I guess it might look like me setting aside a quiet moment, maybe sitting in a safe space at home, and letting myself focus on the memory without trying to block it out. I'd try to notice what I'm feeling—physically and emotionally—and remind myself that I'm safe now, even if the memory feels real. It's about taking it slow, right? Not rushing through it?",client,29,13
"Exactly. I mean, does that feel like something you could picture yourself doing? It'd be a pretty major shift from what you've been doing so far.",therapist,30,13
"I think I can picture it. It does feel like a big shift, but maybe that's what I need. The way I've been handling things hasn't been working, so trying something different might be worth it. I'd need to take it slow, though—one step at a time.",client,31,13
And what might that first step look like?,therapist,32,13
"The first step might be as simple as setting aside five minutes in a quiet space, just to sit with my thoughts. Maybe I could focus on my breathing and remind myself that I'm safe now. I wouldn't try to tackle the biggest memories right away—just ease into it and see how it feels.",client,33,13
"That's huge, Marcus. It won't be an easy practice, but if you can stick with it I think it could really change your relationship to these memories. When do you think you'll get the chance to try it out?",therapist,34,13
"Thanks, Ash. I think I could try it tomorrow evening. I'll make sure I have some quiet time set aside after dinner. It feels a little intimidating, but I'm willing to give it a shot. I appreciate you helping me figure out a way to approach this.",client,35,13
"Hey, Ash. I've been feeling kind of lost lately. It's like I'm stuck in my own head, trying to figure out who I really am, and I don't even know where to start. It's... a lot.",client,1,12
"When you say you're lost, is it more that you don't know what you want, or that you're not sure how you come across to other people?",therapist,2,12
"It's kind of both, I think. I'm not totally sure what I want or who I am yet, and it feels like other people have already figured me out before I even say anything. It's like they put me in a box I'm not sure I fit into. That makes it even harder to figure myself out.",client,3,12
"That's so frustrating, to feel like you're getting labeled or categorized before you even get the chance to speak. What box are people putting you in?",therapist,4,12
"Mostly the box of who they think I should be—like, based on how I look or how they've always known me. It's like people see me a certain way and assume I'm comfortable with it, but I'm not sure I am. I want to explore who I really am, but I feel stuck because of their expectations.",client,5,12
"Got it. And who are these people, exactly? Have you been hearing this from your friends, or your family?",therapist,6,12
"It's a bit of both. My friends don't say much directly, but I can tell they expect me to be the same person I've always been. My family, though... they make comments about how I should act or dress, and it feels like they don't even realize how much it hurts. It's like they don't see me at all.",client,7,12
What are some of the comments that have hurt?,therapist,8,12
"It's little things, like my mom saying, 'You look so nice in that dress', when I don't even feel comfortable wearing it. Or my dad making jokes about how I should be more 'ladylike.' They're not trying to be mean, but it feels like they don't understand how I see myself—or how I want to be seen. It just makes me feel... invisible.",client,9,12
"I can see why. If you had to name one thing you'd like them to understand, what would it be?",therapist,10,12
"I'd want them to understand that I'm still figuring things out, and that's okay. I don't need them to have all the answers—I just need them to support me while I try to find my own. If they could just listen and accept me without trying to fit me into a mold, that would mean so much.",client,11,12
"I hear that. And I want to take a second to appreciate the fact that you are in a moment of exploration right now. That can be a really powerful place to be! If you could learn or explore anything about yourself, what would you want to discover?",therapist,12,12
"I think I'd want to discover what really feels right for me—how I want to present myself to the world and who I am deep down. I want to figure out what makes me feel comfortable and authentic, instead of just going along with what others expect. It's scary, but also exciting to think about.",client,13,12
"It is! And I know your family has been pushing you to act a certain way, but what's felt authentic so far? Have there been any moments where you've been able to let your guard down, and just do what you wanted?",therapist,14,12
"Yeah, there have been a few moments. Like, when I'm with my closest friend, I feel like I can just be myself without worrying about how I look or act. And sometimes, when I'm alone, I'll experiment with clothes or hairstyles that feel more 'me.' Those moments feel freeing, like I'm getting closer to who I want to be.",client,15,12
I love that. What does 'more you' look like?,therapist,16,12
"'More me' feels like being comfortable in my own skin—maybe wearing clothes that aren't so traditionally feminine or trying out a more neutral style. It's also about how I carry myself, feeling confident in who I am rather than trying to fit into someone else's idea of who I should be. It's hard to describe, but it feels lighter, freer.",client,17,12
"And does it ever feel the opposite? Like, heavy or constrained?",therapist,18,12
"Yeah, definitely. It feels heavy when I'm trying to be what other people expect—like wearing something I don't like or acting in a way that doesn't feel right. It's like I'm carrying this invisible weight, and I can't fully relax or just be myself. Those moments make me feel small, like I'm trapped in someone else's version of me.",client,19,12
"And you've been wearing that weight for a while now. As you think about this feeling of being trapped, what does it bring up for you?",therapist,20,12
"It brings up frustration, mostly. Like, why do I have to carry this weight just to make other people comfortable? But it also makes me sad, because I want to feel free to be myself, and right now it feels like I'm stuck hiding parts of who I am. It's exhausting, and sometimes I wonder if it'll ever get easier.",client,21,12
"I get that. If you could do one thing to make it easier, what would it be? You mentioned that you sometimes experiment with your style when you're alone, so maybe you'd want to take that a step further?",therapist,22,12
"I think taking it a step further would mean trying out that style around people I trust—like my closest friend. It's scary to think about, but maybe it would help me feel more comfortable being myself. If I could start small, with someone I know will support me, it might be a good first step.",client,23,12
"You've got this big sense of what feels more like you. And you're wanting to try it out - there's some trepidation, but also some excitement.",therapist,24,12
"Yeah, that's exactly it. I'm nervous, but I'm also excited about the possibility of finally feeling more like myself. It feels like a big step, but I think it could be really freeing if I can take that leap. It's scary, but in a good way.",client,25,12
"Well, what if you didn't take it all at once? You've been testing the waters by yourself, so why not keep doing that, and figure out when you might want to take things public? There wouldn't be any rush!",therapist,26,12
That actually makes a lot of sense. I like the idea of taking my time and not putting pressure on myself to do everything all at once. I can keep experimenting on my own and figure out what feels right before I share it with anyone else. It feels less overwhelming that way.,client,27,12
"And it sounds like you really want to share it with someone. Just to get a bit of validation, or to hear what they think.",therapist,28,12
"Yeah, I do want to share it with someone eventually. I think hearing what they think—especially if it's someone I trust—would help me feel more confident about taking steps toward being myself. It's scary to think about, but it also feels like it could be really validating.",client,29,12
Hi Akash. I've been thinking about you since our last conversation. How are you feeling today?,therapist,1,10
I am feeling anxious about my new years party tonight,client,2,10
What's on your mind about it?,therapist,3,10
I am just going to be seeing a lot of people that I have not seen in a while and I am not sure how it is going to be,client,4,10
"Right, so there are a few unknowns here. Who's coming, just out of curiosity? Friends, family, or a mix?",therapist,5,10
high school friends,client,6,10
And how long has it been since you last saw them?,therapist,7,10
some 4 years which was senior year of high school and others a little more recently,client,8,10
"Okay, so for some of them, it might be a reunion. Are you nervous about how they'll react to you, or maybe about what they'll be like?",therapist,9,10
i think its moreso about going back to high school stereotypes. I think I have been doing a lot better in college compared to high school,client,10,10
Tell me more about that. What's been going better?,therapist,11,10
I just have a better group of solid friends and a girlfriend and I am more confident in myself,client,12,10
"Well, that's awesome! Did you ever feel like you struggled with those things earlier on?",therapist,13,10
not consiously but I think a little bit. I started working out a lot more after Senior year which helped me get more confidence. Before that I did not really talk to girls and my friend group was less defined,client,14,10
"So things have shifted. You're a better version of yourself now, and you're worried that being around these people would bring back that old self.",therapist,15,10
yeah I think so,client,16,10
"What was he like? If you had to describe him in a few words, what would you pick?",therapist,17,10
worried too much what other people thought but was still a hard worker and nice person,client,18,10
"A worried, hard-working, nice person. And what about now? How would you describe yourself these days?",therapist,19,10
much more confident in myself and am comfortable doing things regardless of public perception,client,20,10
"That's a major change! How have you managed to pull it off? I know you mentioned exercise, but I'm guessing there have been other factors, too.",therapist,21,10
I think a lot of it started with exercise and just changed in how people perceived me. From a little bit more dorky to being more attractive and cool.,client,22,10
"So there was a shift in how you were perceived, and that has allowed you to feel more confident in yourself.",therapist,23,10
Yeah partly that and also just having a solid group of friends just allowed me to go try to take more risks and talk to whoever because I knew I always had my friends.,client,24,10
"Right, so these new people have been a huge source of support. How do you think they'd describe you, if they had to? Would they use words like attractive and cool or would they focus on other things?""",therapist,25,10
my friends would focus on like chill and easygoing,client,26,10
"Ah, so even more evidence that you've changed! You were worried about what people thought, and now you're chill and easygoing. Let's go back to the upcoming party and the concerns you have. Where is your mind going when you think about it?",therapist,27,10
I am just worried that some of these kids will still think they are better or more popular than me,client,28,10
"And how would you know if that was the case? Would they say something, or act a certain way?",therapist,29,10
"probbably just act like they are cooler, not try to talk to me etc",client,30,10
"I see. So let's say this does happen. You show up, and they don't make an effort to talk to you. What would that mean to you?",therapist,31,10
I guess it is not a big deal as long as I know I am better now,client,32,10
"That's true! You're not the same as you were in high school, and you've got a lot to be proud of. That said, I know you're still uncomfortable with the idea of being looked down on. How do you think you'll handle it, if people seem dismissive?",therapist,33,10
I do not think I will actually do anything about it but it will just upset me a little bit,client,34,10
What do you think would upset you about it?,therapist,35,10
that is a good question idk,client,36,10
"Well, what if you just didn't get into it with them? Maybe you'd feel a bit hurt, but you'd also be able to enjoy the party, and spend most of your time with people who treat you well. Would that be a realistic goal?",therapist,37,10
yeah thank you,client,38,10
"I know this is a bit of an odd question, but what would it mean to enjoy yourself at this party?",therapist,39,10
just have fun with my friends and reconenct with those who are nice,client,40,10
"And you've got a solid plan for that, right? If anyone is acting too good to talk to you, you'll focus on the people who actually matter.",therapist,41,10
yes awesome thanks,client,42,10
"You're welcome! I know you were feeling a bit daunted by this party, but you've come up with a plan to have fun. As you look ahead, are there any other worries that come to mind?",therapist,43,10
I am now feeling a little bit anxious about a different party I am going to tomorrow,client,1,11
Another party! Tell me about this one.,therapist,2,11
I have to meet all of my girlfriends friends for the first time,client,3,11
"Okay, so you're in a brand new environment, with people you haven't met before. Are you worried about making a good impression on them?",therapist,4,11
yes,client,5,11
I want to hear all about what you want them to see in you.,therapist,6,11
I just want them to like me as a person but they seme much more outgoing than me,client,7,11
"Even if they're a bit more on the social side, that doesn't mean they won't! Did you have a sense of how you might try to connect with them?",therapist,8,11
not really i dont know too much about them or have much overlap with them,client,9,11
So they're brand new people. What do you know about them?,therapist,10,11
i just know that one went to duke and then other went to navy and they just graduated and one is trying to be a nurse. One is named Aida and the other is Giulia and they were best friends with my girlfriend Maya in high school,client,11,11
"Got it, so she knows them really well! Have you talked to her at all about how you're feeling, or about how this might go?",therapist,12,11
i do not think she is worried about it because she said that they are super chill and I am so it will be fine,client,13,11
"Great, so she thinks you'll get along well!",therapist,14,11
yeah,client,15,11
"But you don't sound so sure. Do you think this is more about their personalities, or yours? Like, do you struggle with getting to know new people in general?",therapist,16,11
mine I am on the shyier side so I do not get along with strangers too well,client,17,11
"Okay, so it's not so much about these particular new people. This is about how you tend to feel in situations like this. Tell me some more about being shy.",therapist,18,11
I just keep to myself more and am not as fun and outgoing,client,19,11
"But you're still a good person, right? Someone who your girlfriend really values, and wants her friends to meet?",therapist,20,11
yeah,client,21,11
"So even though you're shy, Maya's friends could get a lot out of meeting you! I'm curious, what do you imagine they'll think of you?",therapist,22,11
I just dont want them to think I am boring and be like Mayas boyfriend is weird,client,23,11
"Ah, so you're hoping to avoid that label. But if you had to pick another one, what would you want them to say? How would you want them to describe you?",therapist,24,11
i would want them to say that I am fun and nice and sweet and they are happy for her,client,25,11
"Ah, I see. You want them to see you as a partner who makes Maya happy.",therapist,26,11
yeah and I do but I just do not know if that will come across in this situation,client,27,11
Because you'll be a bit more reserved than usual?,therapist,28,11
yeah,client,29,11
"I might be reading into this a bit, but could it be that you're worried that shyness will come off as disinterest?",therapist,30,11
"Got it. You want to be fun, and you know that's not your strong suit. But what about the rest of it? Are you confident that you can be nice and sweet, even if you're not the life of the party?",therapist,31,11
yeah,client,32,11
"Okay, so you know what you bring to the table, and you know that Maya loves it. I know you're feeling like you'll be boring at this party - but what do you imagine the people there will notice about you, if you're able to bring your full self?",therapist,33,11
that I am a nice guy,client,34,11
"Well, worst case scenario, that's not a bad thing to be!",therapist,35,11
yeah thank you,client,36,11
"And best case, they feel what Maya feels. That you're not just a nice guy, you're her nice guy.",therapist,37,11
