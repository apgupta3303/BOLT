therapist,"Hey Michelle, how are you doing today?"
client,"Umm I am kind of doing, I'm feeling a little bit stressed out."
therapist,"stressed?"
client,"Yeah, I feel like I have a lot on my plate. I have this test that I have to take for work."
therapist,"What kind of test?"
client,"It's like an aptitude test. It has like math problems on it and like scenarios in order for me to move up to the system manager position."
therapist,"Now, that's a job that you've been interested in for a while."
client,"Yes. Yes. So I've been just feeling a lot of anxiety about taking the test and then they actually scheduled for me to take the test. And I want and I just got really overwhelmed. And I started like I felt my heart was racing. I felt like I wish my hands were shaking. And I just really couldn't concentrate on the test. Even though the night before me and my friend that practice problems, and I knew all the answers with no proper like, I didn't miss any of the questions."
therapist,"so you know the material on this test pretty well?"
client,"yes."
therapist,"But the feelings and that the physiological response to heart rate and sweating, that feelings of anxiety plus those physiological responses they got in the way of you completing it, like you were unable to complete it."
client,"No, I wasn't able to complete it. And thankfully, they gave me a chance to come back. I just told him I didn't feel well. So they rescheduled so now I'm feeling a lot of anxiety because I'm scared the same thing is gonna happe, when I go back."
therapist,"So you weren't you weren't feeling great about taking the test in the first place?"
client,"Today, the night before, I felt like I know all the answers, but the minute I walked into the room, all of a sudden, all these fears kind of took over."
therapist,"But did you know that was coming?"
client,"Yes."
therapist,"you did? Okay."
client,"Yes."
therapist,"So you had some anxiety in advance?"
client,"Yes."
therapist,"or no, you did. Okay."
client,"I had some anxiety the day before. But when I reviewed it with my friend, I'm like, Oh, I know the answers. I thought that would kind of push it down. But I think once I got there, it all came back up to the surface."
therapist,"erupt in that moment, and that prevented you. What do you think is leading to this?"
client,"Well, I've always kind of struggled with tests. I'm like, I can remember when I was in third grade, I had to take this test, because I was really struggling in math. And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade. And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it, I had a tutor, and I felt really prepared for it. And then when I took it, I failed. And I was held back. And I feel like, you know, that was so it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. And I felt like I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time. Because I felt like I really didn't know this. I don't know why I couldn't pass the test."
therapist,"And since that this was third grade."
client,"Yeah."
therapist,"And since that bad testing experience. Have you had trouble with tests since?"
client,"Yes, I always feel really anxious. I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from college. School went on to high school. But it's so hard for me because of this anxiety that I feel that even though I may think I know it, I may still fail the test anyway, maybe like a repeat of what happened."
therapist,"Alright, so in third and third grade, you had a really bad testing experience. And as you move forward from there, you've never really been thrilled about taking tests."
client,"no."
therapist,"But you've been able to adapt. You've been able to take them and still, like pass them."
