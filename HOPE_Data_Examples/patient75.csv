therapist,"Does the feeling itself of not being prepared interfere with preparing?"
client,"Yes, it's really hard. So like when I'm in the middle of being worried, I'm it's really hard for me to focus. So I can't focus on like what I need to do. Because I feel like my mind is on a lot of different things and I can't focus on you know exactly what I should be doing. It's just like, I'm worried about you know, all the different aspects."
therapist,"Alright, so your ability to concentrate and do the hard work of preparing is affected."
client,"Yeah, it's like focus my energy on the right things. I'm just like wasting time worrying."
therapist,"Alright, so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing all this goes on right up until you're getting ready to present."
client,"Yeah. And then like while I'm presenting."
therapist,"so let's talk about that let's go into the actual day a present so we have a successive work coming in it's interfering with your ability but it's distressing for you."
client,"Yeah."
therapist,"Now these presentations are in class?"
client,"Yeah."
therapist,"So it's you're in you're in the classroom. Do you write the only one to present in that classroom is it rotate through several PV?"
client,"It depends on the presentation. Sometimes there's like one or two other people that have to present that night, depending on like how long the topic is."
therapist,"All right, well, let's choose the last time you presented that classes as a template. What was the order to go in there?"
client,"Well, the one that I really messed up, I think in that I was first But usually, like, I'm like, second maybe."
therapist,"Okay. So for this example, let's say you're through the second. Okay, so you're sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting. What's going through mind that?"
client,"I feel like I am totally zoned out. Like I'm not even paying attention to what that person saying, because I'm so worried about how I'm gonna mess it up. You know, I'm, I'm starting to like be sweaty, like my hands are clammy, my heart started to race a little bit, and I'm just totally zoned out on what they're doing. Just, you know, worrying about what's gonna happen when I get up there."
therapist,"So in that moment as you're seated, you're not really watching their presentation as much because you have these strong or somewhat strong physical symptoms. You have your heart racing a bit is sweaty palms. You're zoned out. Have you ever felt the need desire to, like, run out of the room?"
client,"Yes. It's funny you should say that was a little bit hesitant to mention that but I kind of I do I feel like I need to find excuse to like use the bathroom or I just need to get out of there."
therapist,"Yeah, so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room like what? What symptom?"
client,"Um,"
therapist,"And what thoughts are going through your mind right then like, so let's take that kind of severe moment. When you're, you're, let's just say still before the presentation, okay? So you're sitting at the desk and your heart rates elevated. And you're not focusing on what they're doing. You're zoned out your anxieties high. What was going through your mind right, then?"
client,"I think I'm thinking, like, I'm gonna bomb this anyway. So I might as well just, you know, not go through the stress of having to do it. Like I've already in my head, I know that it's going to end badly."
therapist,"So you've already failed."
client,"right. So there's no sense in getting up there. And maybe if I don't get up there, you know, I guess it couldn't be any worse. So I might as well just leave."
therapist,"Are you embarrassed that the professor or other students will see that you were really anxious?"
client,"Yeah, I don't want I figure if I leave and people won't, will just make me think I was sick or whatever. And it'll be a better situation, if I just left then happened to see me up there, you know, sweating and all these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up there, it would be better just to leave before that starts."
therapist,"Okay. So, so better to be thought ill and had to leave because you're saying."
client,"Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody, you know."
therapist,"to have a severe anxiety for that buddy. And then they can very embarrassing. That would be a very undesirable outcome for you."
client,"Right."
therapist,"So as you're debating that thought, because that's coming to your head, and you're thinking I just need to, yeah, gotta get out here. What happens there, so we're maybe What, 15 minutes before we present? So tell me about that. So you have that thought you want to flee."
