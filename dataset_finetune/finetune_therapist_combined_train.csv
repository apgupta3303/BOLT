it it seems like I've used to this question which we called a miracle question,Psychoeducation
no it's actually fairly common but I appreciate you sharing this with I know it's difficult say I'm going to continue on some some other questions appreciate your patience all these these questions and you've been forthcoming with your answers I want to ask you some questions about a possible mood disturbances because this event do you ever find yourself unable to remember having trouble would remember important aspects of the trauma how about negative beliefs or expectations about yourself or others maybe kind of changing your attitude and the way you're relating to the world or yourself if you find yourself having distorted thinking that we kind of blame kind of blame yourself even though you clearly weren't responsible for it,Psychoeducation
so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself,Psychoeducation
we've no Rini to follow guidelines and recommendations on how they've had just had recently updated guidelines we use things like nice guidelines and stuff and you're describing anxiety symptoms that seem to be related to specific issues and we don't think tablets are the best thing anymore we're there's much more recommendation to big you know talking with professionals having what we call CBT cognitive behavioral therapy working through these issues is probably a better long-term option and is what is firstly recommended and second recommendation we try and avoid especially those types of drugs you're talking about valium because we know they just make addicted to them,Psychoeducation
okay and that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happen to you so I would strongly recommend that you have the patch talk about how to use it and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation coming out that typically in that first week so you're happy with the date for me okay would you like to come back and see me again other and what would you like me to do if you don't come back,Psychoeducation
okay those are actually symptoms of hyperglycemia or high blood sugar let's caused by a deficiency of insulin in the body do you know what ketoacidosis is okay when there is no insulin in the body the cells cannot get the energy they need to function to compensate that your body begins breaking down fat body this is what is referred to as ketoacidosis and this can be very life-threatening by leading to coma Oren's of your cases even death so those experiencing I'd usually have stomach pain nausea sometimes I have breath that's most fruity or like they say it smells like acetone or they have very labored reading what they call Kussmaul respirations and this is why taking your insulin injections it's very important so without it your body can't function,Psychoeducation
yeah so exercising did different group of friends that maybe isn't it revolved around smoking with that there's also group therapy that I know you do for your depression which is also awesome to help people stop smoking and we can give you some pamphlets and give you a number that we can set you up with have you ever considered nicotine patches,Psychoeducation

I think I think your life you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem it sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a threat and that something needs to change there are many other things I played two white pain comes about for example how much stress you're under your productivity level much sleep you're getting your emotional health they all play a big role as well you know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pickup basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day does this make sense to you,Psychoeducation
"I understand how that can be confusing, John. It's important to note that ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can have negative effects on your kidneys, particularly when used for an extended period of time. Taking it sparingly may be okay, but I do want to suggest having a conversation with your doctor about other pain management options that might be better for you in the long run. It's always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health.",Psychoeducation
"Yes, that's correct. Soft drinks and other sugary or acidic drinks can contribute to tooth decay by producing harmful acids that erode the enamel on your teeth. It's important to limit your consumption of these types of drinks and if you do have them, it's best to have them with a meal instead of in between meals. Additionally, brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day can also help prevent tooth decay. Would you be willing to try cutting back on your soft drink consumption and incorporating these habits into your daily routine?",Psychoeducation
Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you to feel angry towards your supervisor? Is there something they said or did that upset you? It can be helpful for us to explore the root of these emotions.,Psychoeducation
I love that analogy good thinking good thinking Bruce that's excellent Wow well just to summarize today you came then you had made some progress that you had some stumbling blocks um you have decided that whether it's rain or shine you're going to run anyway because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting a dog you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing ovation okay and in terms of a support group I will send you a list of support groups and you feel that on a scale of one to ten that you're about an eight and actually caring through and drying up two of these support groups because of the hockey team analogy great job so overall how would you rate today's session,Reflections on Strengths
it is a different type of difficulty you're right and I don't want to make light of that but what I'm the point I'm trying to make with you is that it was difficult and you rose to the challenge and you got through it,Reflections on Strengths
well that's a pretty tough decision and um well I really think that you have the personal capabilities to come to that decision on your own I can tell from talking to you that you're a point in your life where you can make big decisions like that on your own,Reflections on Strengths
"""yeah exactly and you know what maintaining your health and maintaining his health is just going to better the both of you anyway so it's always nice to have someone to help support you and what you're doing and going on the walks",Reflections on Strengths
nothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important,Reflections on Strengths
yeah well in like you said you know you've quit many times before and for multiple days and that is a real success and I know that because you ended up going back to smoking that it doesn't feel like a real success but certainly being able to stop for hours or days at a time is really an accomplishment and I hope you can feel that,Reflections on Strengths
so family and responsibilities are tied together for you and responsibility is something that you haven't always been as you would like and yet you've grown in your ability to be responsible possibly partly because of your family,Reflections on Strengths
"Understandable, those were different circumstances and challenges. But it does show that you have the strength and resilience within you to overcome difficult situations. What are some specific concerns or fears you have about quitting right now?",Reflections on Strengths
So maybe quitting can be just as difficult but you have the strength and resilience to face it just like you did with your divorce. Let's work together to develop a plan to help you feel more confident and ready to quit when you're ready. What do you think?,Reflections on Strengths
Sounds like you have a good balance of structured activities and downtime. How have you been feeling lately? Any stress or challenges you currently have on your mind?,Reflections on Strengths
"That's great, it sounds like you're doing well academically. Are there any specific subjects or classes that you're particularly enjoying or struggling with?",Reflections on Strengths
"That's really exciting. It's great to have big goals like that to work towards. It sounds like you're dedicated and hardworking, which will definitely help you achieve those goals. Are there any challenges or concerns that you have right now that you'd like to talk about?",Reflections on Strengths
"That's really insightful, Andrea. It sounds like having a sense of community and feeling like you belong is really important to you, which makes sense given your involvement in various musical ensembles and your desire to become a psychiatrist. It's also great that you prioritize respect, both for yourself and for others. Would you say that these values are currently being met in your life, or is there room for improvement in these areas?",Reflections on Strengths
That sounds like a great plan. It's always helpful when you have a support system that shares similar values and goals. Have you talked to your friends about this at all or do you think they would be open to having this conversation with you?,Reflections on Strengths
"That's a very positive attitude to have. It sounds like you're ready to make some changes and take control of your drinking habits. It can be challenging to make changes, but it sounds like you have a good support system in your friends who share similar goals. Would you like to discuss some strategies that can help you achieve your goal of cutting back on your drinking?",Reflections on Strengths
mmm so you told her many many times yes attention was missing well she didn't work mmm sipping yeah so it sounds like you you feel like she's not listening to you she's always on her fault she could have no face bone why should people calling people up up mhm she have to go to schoo,Reflections on Conflicts
so she's afraid that if you take the children with you that you'll be drinking and then you might hurt them or,Reflections on Conflicts
so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now,Reflections on Conflicts
all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to,Reflections on Conflicts
and it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately,Reflections on Conflicts
okay I hear you so on one hand you feel confident that you're able to manage this home course load and the stress level and on the other hand you're unsure because you don't have the same social support it's like you did back home,Reflections on Conflicts
so you have some internal voices that's disputing probably maybe wait okay with you whether you should or shouldn't exercise and diet look after your health,Reflections on Conflicts
so it seems like you're kind of conflicted about what's going on you know I'm hear you say that you got sick and it wasn't really big deal but it seems like your parents may have been your opinion overreacted,Reflections on Conflicts
"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand he's really good, good with you, and good with the father, I mean good with your child, and on the other hand it was like what is this? Something really different",Reflections on Conflicts
well so Linda what I'm hearing you say is that it's actually very important for you to exercise but on the other hand you are not that confidence to actually start a success is that true,Reflections on Conflicts
yeah totally okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is always making you do things like chores and making you you go with him to places that you don't really want to go to is that right,Reflections on Conflicts
oh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure i have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then i can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising it certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising?,Reflections on Conflicts
You're stuck between the demands of being a mother and of being a woman.,Reflections on Conflicts
"Your family comes first, but doing well at work takes time away from them.",Reflections on Conflicts
so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,Reflections on Consequences
yeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking,Reflections on Consequences
this scholarship will really help you achieving your goals,Reflections on Consequences
ok behavior like this could get you suspended doesn't that concern you,Reflections on Consequences
and you're in you know that if you lost some weight that then you'd have less pressure on those knees in you can be you,Reflections on Consequences
so she's afraid that if you take the children with you that you'll be drinking and then you might hurt them or,Reflections on Consequences
"""yeah exactly and you know what maintaining your health and maintaining his health is just going to better the both of you anyway so it's always nice to have someone to help support you and what you're doing and going on the walks",Reflections on Consequences
yeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about  to  pounds,Reflections on Consequences
"Okay, I understand that the pain can be difficult and discouraging. In order to make the injections easier and less painful, have you spoken with your doctor about using a smaller needle or using a numbing cream before injecting? It could help make the process less painful for you in the long run.",Reflections on Consequences
"Okay, I can understand how painful injections can impact your daily life. It's important to let your doctor know about your concerns and any pain you're experiencing with the injections. They may be able to provide some tips or alternatives to make the injections more comfortable for you. Additionally, it's important to follow the prescribed instructions for using insulin to ensure that it is effectively managing your blood sugar levels and preventing complications. Let's refill your prescription for now and I will provide you with resources to help you manage your pain and use the insulin as prescribed.",Reflections on Consequences
okay so it sounds like when you choose to drink it's more of a social gathering with lots of people and when you choose not to drink it's more low-key and laid-back with close friends or just hanging out at home. Is that accurate?,Reflections on Consequences
okay so you enjoy both of those types of activities but they do serve different purposes for you and you kind of have different levels of engagement and energy during them okay and have you ever noticed any negative consequences of drinking at parties or social events?,Reflections on Consequences
it's important to note that alcohol is sort of a temporary solution to help relax and enjoy the party atmosphere. It's also important to remember to drink responsibly and in moderation. Would you be open to discussing some strategies or alternatives to drinking at parties that would still allow you to have fun and feel included in the group?,Reflections on Consequences
"Okay, so it sounds like alcohol can help you relax and have fun with your friends but you also recognize that excessive drinking can have negative consequences. Have you ever experienced any negative consequences or witnessed them in others due to alcohol use?",Reflections on Consequences
"If you got to dinner with your mother, you end up embarrassed.",Reflections on Consequences
Every time you drink you have to spend a week apologizing.,Reflections on Consequences
so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,Planning
okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,Planning
take it a half hour before breakfast and again a half hour before dinner if you can but it's important just to remember to take that twice a day,Planning
I want you this week to make a list in your journal of the times that you've used your stock technique you've already used at one so go ahead and you can put that could be your first entry,Planning
okay so since I'm gonna see you back in two minutes in two weeks sorry I would like you to actually notes when you actually go to the gym and also when you use the staircase and bring it back write it down in your journal and would know the next step from there okay thank you,Planning
yeah and so help is available I have a few substance abuse places that I'd like to refer you to and maybe some hey have you heard of alcohol Anonymous meetings as we mentioned before support group and your church as you mentioned so these are the avenues that you said you would like to go into,Planning
all right and if it's okay I'd like to call you in a week to one see how you're feeling and to the exercise is helping you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial you may actually look forward to it because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood and then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things now we've talked about exercise apartment we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point but I want you to know you know you can call anytime and I will work to get you in and that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not workin,Planning
what would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference,Planning
okay so Dana I'm hearing you say that running brings you a really great sense of calmness would this be something we could set as maybe homework for next time like in between our next session now in our next session for you to try running again to replace the calmness smoking brings to you,Planning
we've no Rini to follow guidelines and recommendations on how they've had just had recently updated guidelines we use things like nice guidelines and stuff and you're describing anxiety symptoms that seem to be related to specific issues and we don't think tablets are the best thing anymore we're there's much more recommendation to big you know talking with professionals having what we call CBT cognitive behavioral therapy working through these issues is probably a better long-term option and is what is firstly recommended and second recommendation we try and avoid especially those types of drugs you're talking about valium because we know they just make addicted to them,Planning

So maybe quitting can be just as difficult but you have the strength and resilience to face it just like you did with your divorce. Let's work together to develop a plan to help you feel more confident and ready to quit when you're ready. What do you think?,Planning
"That's definitely a positive step in the right direction. Cutting down can be a good starting point. Let's explore some strategies that have worked for you in the past to help you cut down and eventually quit altogether. We can also address any underlying emotions or behaviors that may be contributing to your smoking behavior. Together, we can develop a plan that works best for you. It's important to remember that change takes time and it's okay if the process is slow. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable and confident in your progress.",Planning
"Great, we can definitely set up another appointment in a couple of weeks to check on your progress towards your goals. In the meantime, it might be helpful to start thinking about specific activities or events you could participate in that don't revolve around drinking. You could also try reaching out to your friends and discussing how you feel and maybe even finding some non-drinking buddies to join you in some activities. Remember, you can always refer back to your goal and your reasons for cutting down on drinking as motivation to stay on track.",Planning
"It's understandable that giving up soft drinks can be challenging. However, cutting back on soft drinks is a significant step forward towards healthier teeth. You can try substituting soft drinks with water or herbal tea or drinking them only during meal times. Additionally, it's crucial to brush your teeth twice a day, floss daily, and visit a dentist regularly to maintain good oral health. We can slowly work towards reducing your soft drink consumption and improving your overall dental health as we move forward with your treatment.",Planning
It sounds like your anger is manifesting physically in your body. It's not uncommon for emotions to be felt physically in our bodies. I'm wondering if we can work together to find some ways to manage your anger so that it doesn't take over and cause physical discomfort for you? Would you be open to exploring some coping strategies with me?,Planning
and again thanks for your honesty in talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know on the one hand you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter,Reflections on Values
so independence and privacy were important to you in terms of you know what you value in your life so when you think about independence and you think about privacy where do you see cutting impacting that like how does that fit with those two things how does cutting fit with independence why don't we start there,Reflections on Values
it it's a big thing your mom is really important to you of course and how she feels about you is important how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit a lot,Reflections on Values
mm-hmm you really value your self and your well-being and in your spirit and it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and even though things started out well they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself no but you know but she's lovely,Reflections on Values
so it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children it's obvious that you're a good mom and if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear,Reflections on Values
so it seems like you're kind of conflicted about what's going on you know I'm hear you say that you got sick and it wasn't really big deal but it seems like your parents may have been your opinion overreacted,Reflections on Values
"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand he's really good, good with you, and good with the father, I mean good with your child, and on the other hand it was like what is this? Something really different",Reflections on Values
okay so we've talked about where you are in terms of wanting change we talked about where you act as far as feeling confident in change we also discussed a little bit about the reasons why you want to change the three reasons you mentioned your mom you mentioned for yourself you mentioned your health in the session we also discussed some avenues that you may take in terms of getting that support that you want we talked about your belief system a little bit we talked about church we talked about referrals in places that you may be interested in so you talked about a lot and I want to hear from you how is this going for you how how was the session been going for you in the past the last session that we had before,Reflections on Values
nothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important,Reflections on Values
so family and responsibilities are tied together for you and responsibility is something that you haven't always been as you would like and yet you've grown in your ability to be responsible possibly partly because of your family,Reflections on Values
"Absolutely, John. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being. We can always explore alternative pain management options that won't harm your kidneys. Additionally, I highly recommend speaking with your doctor to discuss any concerns or questions you may have about your medications and their potential interactions. Would you like me to make a note to follow up with you on this during our next session?",Reflections on Values
"I see, so going through your divorce was really tough. And it sounds like you're saying that quitting is not up there with the same level of difficulty as going through your divorce. Is that accurate?",Reflections on Values
"I hear you, Rachel. It sounds like you are highly motivated to make this change for your own health and to prevent any potential health issues in the future. What steps have you already taken towards this goal, and what do you think is holding you back from reaching it?",Reflections on Values
It sounds like you have a lot of motivation and drive to make changes in your life to improve your health. That's a great starting point. Are there any specific goals or steps you have in mind to get started on this journey?,Reflections on Values
"Great, those are important values to have in life. Can you tell me a little bit more about why those values are important to you?",Reflections on Values
That makes a lot of sense. It's really great that you recognize those values as important to you and hold them close. Have you ever felt like those values have been challenged or maybe not met in certain situations?,Reflections on Values
"That's really insightful, Andrea. It sounds like having a sense of community and feeling like you belong is really important to you, which makes sense given your involvement in various musical ensembles and your desire to become a psychiatrist. It's also great that you prioritize respect, both for yourself and for others. Would you say that these values are currently being met in your life, or is there room for improvement in these areas?",Reflections on Values
"Okay, it sounds like you're keeping a balance and trying to really be thoughtful about your own safety and wellbeing while still being able to enjoy yourself. It's good to hear that you're looking out for yourself and trying to make choices that respect your own boundaries and safety.",Reflections on Values
that's really smart to take that control for yourself and make your own drink and kind of monitor yourself and stay within your limits that you've set for yourself. It sounds like you're really being mindful about the decisions you're making around drinking and that's really important. It also sounds like you're setting yourself up for success by making sure you're in a safe environment and limiting your drinking to one drink. Is there anything else that you've found helpful in managing your drinking?,Reflections on Values
"I hear you, it sounds like taking care of your body is a top priority for you and you want to ensure that your drinking habits align with that. It's important to keep in mind that making changes to your drinking habits can be a gradual process and it's okay if it takes some time to get where you want to be. Have you considered setting specific goals for yourself or potentially seeking additional support, like a therapist or support group?",Reflections on Values
"Okay, so it's not the highest priority for you right now but it's still something that you want to work on and improve in your life. That's understandable. It's important to recognize and acknowledge the things we want to work on and make progress towards. Are there any specific steps you've thought of that might help you cut back on your drinking?",Reflections on Values

nothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important,Questions on Perspectives

Is there anything else you would like to talk about or any other concerns you have regarding your oral health?",Problem-Solving

It's important to limit your consumption of these types of drinks and if you do have them, it's best to have them with a meal instead of in between meals. Additionally, brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day can also help prevent tooth decay. Would you be willing to try cutting back on your soft drink consumption and incorporating these habits into your daily routine?",Problem-Solving
"It's understandable that giving up soft drinks can be challenging. However, cutting back on soft drinks is a significant step forward towards healthier teeth. You can try substituting soft drinks with water or herbal tea or drinking them only during meal times. Additionally, it's crucial to brush your teeth twice a day, floss daily, and visit a dentist regularly to maintain good oral health. We can slowly work towards reducing your soft drink consumption and improving your overall dental health as we move forward with your treatment.",Problem-Solving
"Okay, one option could be to switch to sugar-free drinks, such as water, or to limit your consumption of soft drinks to once a day during a meal. Another option could be to sip on soft drinks through a straw, as this can help reduce the amount of contact between the drink and your teeth. It's important to also maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day and flossing daily. Would you be willing to try any of these options?",Problem-Solving
"That's a great plan, Lucy. And in addition to that, you could also try to swap out soft drinks for water or unsweetened beverages throughout the day. It's also important to make sure you're brushing twice a day and flossing daily to help prevent any further dental decay. I can also refer you to a dentist to get that filling taken care of if you'd like. Does that sound good to you?",Problem-Solving

you're saying um you also mentioned that you know you go to the bar with your boyfriend a lot do you think that there's any alternative things you guys can do together like possibly like go to the library and son together or you know just kind of have like i annoy you to stay in on the weekends instead of going out,Questions on Experiences
I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things you know even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking and the fact that you you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth for sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse I guess,Questions on Experiences
okay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go,Questions on Experiences

what would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference,Questions on Experiences
well so Linda what I'm hearing you say is that it's actually very important for you to exercise but on the other hand you are not that confidence to actually start a success is that true,Questions on Experiences
you decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing and when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home you decided to drive yourself home did I get that right,Questions on Experiences
okay good good so what are you saying correct me if I'm wrong is you think that logging your sugar intake is going to help you see on top of the way you feel after you eat candy how much can you you're actually eating,Questions on Experiences

okay so we've talked about where you are in terms of wanting change we talked about where you act as far as feeling confident in change we also discussed a little bit about the reasons why you want to change the three reasons you mentioned your mom you mentioned for yourself you mentioned your health in the session we also discussed some avenues that you may take in terms of getting that support that you want we talked about your belief system a little bit we talked about church we talked about referrals in places that you may be interested in so you talked about a lot and I want to hear from you how is this going for you how how was the session been going for you in the past the last session that we had before,Questions on Experiences
nothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important,Questions on Experiences
so you felt fatigued and somewhat depressed while you were on the Atkins diet that's something I hear not yeah pretty it's pretty often I think that if it's okay we could talk about that for a minute if that's something,Questions on Experiences
no it's actually fairly common but I appreciate you sharing this with I know it's difficult say I'm going to continue on some some other questions appreciate your patience all these these questions and you've been forthcoming with your answers I want to ask you some questions about a possible mood disturbances because this event do you ever find yourself unable to remember having trouble would remember important aspects of the trauma how about negative beliefs or expectations about yourself or others maybe kind of changing your attitude and the way you're relating to the world or yourself if you find yourself having distorted thinking that we kind of blame kind of blame yourself even though you clearly weren't responsible for it,Questions on Experiences
what do you feel about the possibility of doing some of that thinking and looking in with another person I hear you clearly saying I don't need you know help I don't need therapy I don't need treatment of any kind but I'm thinking about the exploration area of that and whether or not you have thoughts on how helpful it might be to sit down and be able to sort of chat with somebody about the connection between the alcohol issue and the anger issue and coming back from the war issue and that kind of thing,Questions on Experiences
so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself,Questions on Experiences
okay and that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happen to you so I would strongly recommend that you have the patch talk about how to use it and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation coming out that typically in that first week so you're happy with the date for me okay would you like to come back and see me again other and what would you like me to do if you don't come back,Questions on Experiences
okay those are actually symptoms of hyperglycemia or high blood sugar let's caused by a deficiency of insulin in the body do you know what ketoacidosis is okay when there is no insulin in the body the cells cannot get the energy they need to function to compensate that your body begins breaking down fat body this is what is referred to as ketoacidosis and this can be very life-threatening by leading to coma Oren's of your cases even death so those experiencing I'd usually have stomach pain nausea sometimes I have breath that's most fruity or like they say it smells like acetone or they have very labored reading what they call Kussmaul respirations and this is why taking your insulin injections it's very important so without it your body can't function,Questions on Experiences
yeah so exercising did different group of friends that maybe isn't it revolved around smoking with that there's also group therapy that I know you do for your depression which is also awesome to help people stop smoking and we can give you some pamphlets and give you a number that we can set you up with have you ever considered nicotine patches,Questions on Experiences
okay awesome so when it comes to carbohydrate crowning we always want to make sure that we're aware of the carpod so if you know what a carbohydrate is,Questions on Experiences
oh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure i have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then i can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising it certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising?,Questions on Experiences

Is there anything else you would like to talk about or any other concerns you have regarding your oral health?",Questions on Experiences
